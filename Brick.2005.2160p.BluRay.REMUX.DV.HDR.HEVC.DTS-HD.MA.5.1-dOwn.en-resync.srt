1
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,615
<i>How's things?</i>

2
00:02:12,617 --> 00:02:14,494
Status quo.

3
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,081
<i>Yeah?</i>
Mm-hmm.

4
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,043
<i>That's good.</i>

5
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:31,135
What's going on, Em?

6
00:02:31,136 --> 00:02:35,724
<i>Yeah, it's good
to see you, Brendan.</i>

7
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:40,060
<i>It's been some time.</i>

8
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,520
Two months.

9
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:45,191
<i>Yeah, I didn't even know
your locker.</i>

10
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:47,359
<i>I had to ask Brain.</i>

11
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,197
Em, why don't we meet
somewhere?

12
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:53,449
<i>Mm, I can't.</i>

13
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,326
Why not?

14
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:56,202
<i>I screwed up real bad.</i>

15
00:02:56,203 --> 00:03:00,332
<i>You know?
I really screwed up.</i>

16
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:02,208
Screwed up how?

17
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:03,959
<i>I-I did what she said
with the brick.</i>

18
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,170
<i>I-I didn't know
it was bad.</i>

19
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:07,171
<i>But put the Pin's on it
now for poor Frisco,</i>

20
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:09,298
<i>and they're playing it
all on me.</i>

21
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:10,674
Slow down.
Now, what?

22
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:13,719
You gotta help me,
Brendan, please.

23
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,307
<i>I think Tug--
Oh, no!</i>

24
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:05,938
Brain.

25
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,315
Brendan, it's been a while.
Where you been eatin'?

26
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:11,151
- Back of school.
- Yeah, no one's seen you.

27
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:14,071
- What's it been,
a couple of months?
- It's been a while.

28
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:16,198
Did you gave Emily
my locker number?

29
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,200
- Few days ago.
Was I wrong?
- No.

30
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:20,661
It's been so long, I don't
know your two's stats.

31
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:21,621
Yeah,
it's been a while.

32
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:24,999
Who's she been
eating with?

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,835
I don't know.
That's hard to keep track.

34
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:29,169
- Is it?
- Can be.

35
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,671
Can be hard
to keep track
of those things,

36
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:33,549
because lunch
is, um, a lot of things.

37
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,594
Lunch is difficult.

38
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:42,224
She hadn't been doin'
too good, Brendan.

39
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:44,059
Yeah, well,
I'm not looking
for a patch-up.

40
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,353
Em's life is her own,
but she asked
for my help.

41
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:47,730
- Help with what?
- I don't know.

42
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:49,773
I don't even care.
It's not my business.

43
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:51,191
I just want to know
she's okay.

44
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:54,194
We gotta find her.
That's all this is.

45
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:57,197
I know she's been poking in
with the Ivy-bound
cheerleading elite.

46
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:59,533
- Laura Dannon's crowd.
- Laura Dannon there
on the Linc'?

47
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:02,536
And Brad Bramish,
cream on the upper crust.

48
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:05,205
Em tagged after them
for a bit, but it
didn't work out.

49
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:06,749
She picked her way
down the food chain.

50
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,710
Last I saw she was
with what's-her-name,
the drama vamp.

51
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:11,171
Small-time dealer,
evil one.

52
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:12,505
- The one you dated.
- Kara.

53
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:14,882
That's my bus.
You know her locker number?

54
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:16,091
Kara's?
Em's.

55
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:17,384
269.
Thanks, Brain.

56
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:20,179
Keep your specs on,
find me if she shows.

57
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,932
Will do.

58
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:53,171
Hello, Kara.

59
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,680
- Hello, Brendan.
- Kara.

60
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:05,516
- Come to see the show?
- No, I didn't.

61
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:08,018
Lapdog, blow.

62
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,186
Stay.

63
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:11,063
- I need words.
- Well, I'm listening.

64
00:06:11,064 --> 00:06:13,775
About Emily Kostich.

65
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,653
Run and get my purse.
Go on. Hurry up.

66
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:19,196
Still picking your teeth
with freshmen?

67
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:23,200
- You were a freshman once.
- Way once, sister.

68
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:24,493
You and Em,
tight for a bit.

69
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:26,954
- Who's she eating with now?
- Eating with?

70
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:28,956
Eating with.
Lunch. Who?

71
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:31,333
You're a cutie.

72
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:33,211
Brendan.

73
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:35,170
I don't know
where she is.

74
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:37,840
I know you do,
so why don't you
want me to find out?

75
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:42,178
Well, maybe
I'm looking out for you.

76
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:44,723
Oh, I appreciate that.

77
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:48,059
Brendan.

78
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:53,439
If you're ever looking
to get back into things,

79
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,650
I could use you.

80
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:12,166
Go. Say your line, okay?

81
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,584
- No.
- So, I just--

82
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:17,338
No, he's gotta come in first
and then you say your line.

83
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,091
And then he crosses.

84
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:52,915
<i>Hello?</i>

85
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes. Hello, ma'am,
this is Tom.

86
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:59,171
I'm a friend from school.
Could I speak to--

87
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:03,176
<i>Oh sure, Tom.</i>
<i>Laura's here.</i>
<i>Just a sec.</i>

88
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:06,553
<i>Yes?</i>
I'm calling for details.

89
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:09,181
<i>For what?</i>
Details about the party.

90
00:08:09,182 --> 00:08:10,224
Who is this? Or I'll hang up.

91
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:12,643
- You don't know me.
I'll save you some time.
<i>- I know everyone,</i>

92
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:17,189
<i>- and I have all the time</i>
<i>in the world.</i>
- The folly of youth.

93
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,483
Ask whose invitation
I've got.

94
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:22,069
What you said.

95
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,030
Emily Kostich.

96
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:28,242
<i>15 Busch Streetin Stockton Cove.</i>

97
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:30,953
Buzz 42 at the gate. 9:00.

98
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:33,039
<i>But who gave you--</i>

99
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:42,441
And the stupid coach--
the coach won't let me play!

100
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:44,736
So, cheers!

101
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:49,948
Beautiful.
I am Brad Bramish, Coach!

102
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,491
You gotta let me play!

103
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:53,744
How am I supposed
to put in my best game...

104
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:56,538
if I'm worried
about whether or not...

105
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,458
I'm gonna be in there?

106
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:18,185
What are you doing here?

107
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:19,186
Leaving.

108
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:21,898
Oh, yeah?

109
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:57,933
Brad's not the kind of guy
you want to mess with.

110
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,982
Fearless Flyer.

111
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,402
Quit your yappin'
and fix me one.

112
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:14,701
Mm. I'll never get
through all this.

113
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:32,384
- So why are you here tonight?
- I'm looking for Emily.

114
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:33,719
Em's been AWOL
for a good month.

115
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,597
- Nobody's seen her.
- I saw her yesterday.

116
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:38,725
Nearly nobody.

117
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:40,267
Listen,
you're scratching
at the wrong door.

118
00:11:40,268 --> 00:11:43,395
I didn't know Em well enough
to know the details of what
she was in,

119
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:45,188
I just got wind
of the downfall.

120
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:46,481
If you haven't got
a finger in Em's troubles,

121
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:50,944
then why did her name
get me into your rather
exclusive party?

122
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:52,029
Keep up with me now.

123
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,116
I don't know,
but it sounded
like you did.

124
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:59,537
And a body's got a right
to be curious.

125
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:03,540
- Now I'm not so sure.
- Oh, put that body to bed.

126
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,169
I don't know a damn thing
about whatever troubles...

127
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,838
and that works for me.

128
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:13,343
I just want
to find her.

129
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:19,182
Coffee and Pie.

130
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:24,186
Coffee and Pie,
Oh My?

131
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:26,981
And you didn't
hear it from me.

132
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:41,620
It's Tugger.

133
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,539
All right.

134
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,544
Will you wait here
for me?
Sure.

135
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:51,463
You'll sit right here
and wait?

136
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:54,174
I'll just be
five minutes.
Yes.

137
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:56,010
Okay.

138
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,961
- Why don't you say something?
- I will not talk about this.

139
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:33,338
We'll talk about
this right now!
I won't!

140
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:35,508
We'll talk
about this!

141
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:39,178
I promise you.

142
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,444
Where's Dode?

143
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,196
Hey, Brendan.

144
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:42,366
Maybe you shouldn't be here.

145
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:52,667
Kara told me
you know where Em's at.
Uh-huh.

146
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:56,171
And why you looking
for Em?
She asked for my help.

147
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:57,589
Uh-huh.
Well, listen, man,

148
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,259
I got plenty on my plate
without dealing with
some jilted ex.

149
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,178
It's not about that.

150
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:06,056
Whatever it's about,
act smarter than you look
and drop it.

151
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:07,098
Where's she at?

152
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:10,186
You better get
while it's good.

153
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:19,737
Heel it now, dig?

154
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,033
- Uh, yo--
- Throw one at me
if you want, hash-head!

155
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,202
I got all five senses
and I slept last night.

156
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:31,207
- That puts me six up
on the lot of you.
- Easy, bro.

157
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:44,720
Where's Em?

158
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:49,599
All right! All right.
All right.

159
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,434
All right, man.

160
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:54,188
Where's Em?

161
00:15:56,857 --> 00:16:01,194
She's with me.
She was tight
when she called you, man.

162
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:05,282
Came to and freaked,
told me to shake you
if you came by.

163
00:16:05,283 --> 00:16:08,536
Said you'd only
make things worse.

164
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,964
Deal with whatever
this ain't about and drop it!

165
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:21,172
Tell Em I want
to see her.

166
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:23,883
Tell her if she wants
my help or not,
it's her business.

167
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:26,595
But I want to hear it
straight from her.
She don't wanna--

168
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:29,014
Today! She knows
where I eat lunch.

169
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:31,892
And stay out, man!

170
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:34,473
I must've sounded
pretty crazy on the phone
yesterday.

171
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:38,184
You just gotta
forget about it.

172
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:41,688
That's how you can
help me out is just,

173
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:45,192
please,
forget about it.

174
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:55,076
Brendan,
I know that you're mad
at all these people...

175
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:58,204
because you think
I went away from you
and went to them,

176
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,205
but...

177
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,292
you gotta start
seeing it as my decision.

178
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:05,837
You know, stop getting angry
just because where
I wanna be at...

179
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:08,465
is different
from where you
wanna be at, okay?

180
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:10,926
Who fed you
that line, Em?

181
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:15,889
Stop picking on Dode, okay?
He's a good guy.

182
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,307
The pie house rat?

183
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:20,770
Yeah.
He's a good friend.

184
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:24,398
So what am I?

185
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:29,527
Yeah, I mean,
what are you, um,

186
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:33,072
eating back here,
hating everybody?

187
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:36,702
I mean, who are you
judging anyone?

188
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:42,208
God, I really
loved you a lot.

189
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:46,879
I couldn't stand it.
I had to get with people.

190
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:50,173
I couldn't heckle life
with you anymore.

191
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:53,177
I'm so sorry.

192
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,014
I'm sorry.

193
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:01,476
I'm sorry,
Brendan.

194
00:20:01,477 --> 00:20:03,604
I'm sorry.

195
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:11,903
You gotta
come back to me, Em.

196
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:14,197
No!
You're in a spot,
but I can get you out.

197
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,281
Come back to me.
You're not hearing me!

198
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,659
I don't wanna be put away
and protected.
I'll deal with--

199
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,788
No!
Tell me about the trouble
with the brick, the Pin.

200
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:25,793
Are you going to fix things
like you did with Jerr?

201
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:28,170
No. Okay?

202
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:33,175
I came here to say
good-bye, okay?
For good.

203
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:39,180
Whatever you have to do
to let me go,

204
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:40,390
you gotta do it.

205
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:43,852
You gotta
promise me though, okay?

206
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,188
You have to, that--

207
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,191
that you're not--

208
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:53,278
you're not gonna
torture yourself.

209
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,571
Please?

210
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:58,200
That you're just
gonna let me go.

211
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:07,918
Just let me go.

212
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:58,843
Do you know
anything else about this?

213
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:00,803
No.
Slim pickings.

214
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:04,724
Why'd you let Dode fly
when he went back to
who's-her-name in theater?

215
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:05,392
Kara?
It's their turf.

216
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:08,186
I couldn't hear 'em
without being seen, and that
would only biff their play.

217
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:11,230
Best to know it's there,
let it ride and see what
comes of it. Anyway.

218
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:14,901
If this is what I think
it is, it didn't come
straight from Dode.

219
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:17,195
Unless he's playing
out of his league.

220
00:22:17,196 --> 00:22:20,324
- I could only give you
my best guess.
- Yeah.

221
00:22:20,783 --> 00:22:22,909
When the upper crust
does shady deeds,

222
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,203
they do them
in different places
around town.

223
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:26,412
One of them
is by the pier.

224
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,914
Another is by
the bike trails
of state park.

225
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:32,001
There's a lot of 'em,
and the pitch is they've got
little symbols for each one...

226
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:35,129
so they can tell each other
the place without word
getting around.

227
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,173
- This might be that.
- But Dode wouldn't know it?

228
00:22:37,174 --> 00:22:38,758
No, this is
the upper crust.
Dode's pie-pan grease.

229
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,386
- Call anything up?
- How many places
start with "A"?

230
00:22:41,387 --> 00:22:44,097
Or if it's a shape,
could be a random symbol.

231
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,807
Even if you figure it out,
what good would you do?

232
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:49,644
You said her business
was none of yours.
So she's all right.

233
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:51,562
Forget it now.

234
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:53,524
Go home, sleep.

235
00:26:05,424 --> 00:26:08,176
Brendan, you're up early.

236
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:10,179
Couldn't sleep.

237
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:13,182
Find Emily?

238
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:19,438
You all right?

239
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:22,773
Yeah. What are you
here for? Zero?

240
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:24,650
Forced into taking
the early bus.

241
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:27,321
The others don't run
by my street.

242
00:26:27,988 --> 00:26:30,156
So what's the word
with Em?

243
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:33,452
She's gone.

244
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:36,163
Can't raise her?

245
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:40,167
No, I can't.

246
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:46,173
So what now?

247
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:50,761
Now, I don't know,
I guess, uh--

248
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:54,473
I don't know.

249
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,728
I can't let
her go, Brain.

250
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:05,317
I was set to,
but I can't.
I don't think I can.

251
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,030
Do you think
you can help her?

252
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:12,741
No.

253
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:16,285
You think you
can get this straight,

254
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:19,623
maybe break some
deserving teeth?

255
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:22,501
Yeah, I think I could.

256
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:25,420
Well?

257
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:32,468
Tell me to walk
from this, Brain.

258
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:34,053
Tell me to drop it.

259
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:36,598
Walk from it.
Drop it.

260
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:42,103
But you're thick,
Brendan.

261
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:44,189
Yes, I am.

262
00:27:52,114 --> 00:27:54,116
I need you to op.

263
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,741
Like on Jerr,
but that was cake to this.

264
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:59,203
And unlike Jerr,
there's not much chance
coming out clean.

265
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:01,414
24-7 on this one.

266
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:04,208
You okay to op
for me again?

267
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:06,168
So what first,
tip the bulls?

268
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:07,462
No, bulls
would gum it.

269
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:10,172
They'd flash
their dusty standards
at the wide-eyes,

270
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:11,215
probably find
some yegg to pin,

271
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:12,842
probably even
the right one.

272
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:14,176
But they'd trample
the real tracks...

273
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:15,678
and scare
the real players
back into their holes.

274
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,638
If we're doing this
I want the whole story.

275
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,807
No cops,
not for a bit.

276
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:21,183
So what's first?

277
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:22,560
I don't know.

278
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:24,186
- Your mom still have
that cell?
- In her car.

279
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:26,188
May I borrow it
for a few days?
Get me the number?

280
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:28,984
- Yeah.
- Wait for my word.

281
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:32,361
And, um,
cover for me first.

282
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:35,948
I'm, uh, gonna be
a little late.

283
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:37,283
<i>What did you do? Stop it!</i>

284
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:39,660
What did you do? Are you crying for him?

285
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:40,953
You're crying for Jerr?

286
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:42,246
<i>Trueman went
straight for him!</i>

287
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:43,914
<i>He knew the lay!
You ratted on Jerr!</i>

288
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:44,915
Stop it now, Em!

289
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:46,917
<i>Are you telling me it isn't true?
Look at me!</i>

290
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:48,252
<i>You ratted him out
because you were jealous.</i>

291
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:50,921
No, I spun on him and bulled the two-bit toker...

292
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:52,381
'cause I know what his world would do to you!

293
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:54,842
I love you
<i>too much to see that. You don't love me!</i>

294
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:58,888
You just wanna keep me. You're the only thing I love!

295
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:03,852
You're the only thing I love. And this is how I do it.

296
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,900
I wanna keep you safe.

297
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:23,871
You can't keep me safe,
Brendan, all right?

298
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:25,122
I'm in
a different world now.

299
00:29:25,123 --> 00:29:29,001
And you can't
keep me out of it
and you can't beat it,

300
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:31,588
not if I don't
want you to.

301
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:26,851
Here's the cell number.
Keep it on vibrate.

302
00:30:26,852 --> 00:30:28,185
Yeah.
Better stop meeting me
in the open too.

303
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:30,521
I'm gonna start getting
visible. I need you
on the underneath.

304
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:33,315
I'll call.
Trueman the Ass V.P.
wants words.

305
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:35,151
I'll bet he does.
Keep him off me.

306
00:30:35,152 --> 00:30:36,193
Stonewall him.
He won't bite.

307
00:30:36,194 --> 00:30:38,529
Keep him away from me.
I'll try.
So what's first?

308
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,489
Make Em's troubles mine.

309
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,408
Emily said four words
I didn't know.

310
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:45,202
"Brick"?

311
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:46,996
- No.
- Or "bad brick"?

312
00:30:46,997 --> 00:30:48,205
- No.
- "Tug"?

313
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:52,084
Tug. Tug might be a drink.

314
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:56,172
Like milk and vodka
or something.

315
00:30:56,173 --> 00:30:58,507
"Poor Frisco"?

316
00:30:58,508 --> 00:30:59,550
Frisco.

317
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:01,552
Frisco Farr was
a sophomore last year.

318
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:03,387
Real trash,
maybe hit a class a week.

319
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,681
Didn't know him then,
hadn't seen him around.

320
00:31:05,682 --> 00:31:07,183
- "Pin."
- Pin.

321
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:09,602
- The Pin?
- The Pin, yeah?

322
00:31:09,603 --> 00:31:11,562
The Pin's kind of
a local spook story.

323
00:31:11,563 --> 00:31:13,147
- You know, the Kingpin.
- I've heard it.

324
00:31:13,148 --> 00:31:16,650
Same thing.
Supposed to be old,
like 26, lives in town.

325
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:17,776
Dope runner, right?
Big time.

326
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:22,657
See, the Pin pipes it
from the lowest scrapper
to Brad Bramish himself.

327
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:25,409
Maybe. Ask any dope rat
where the junk sprang,

328
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,203
and they'll say
they scraped it off that...

329
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:28,412
who scored it off this,
who bought it off someone.

330
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:32,208
After four
or five connections, the list
always ends with the Pin.

331
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:34,418
But I betcha you
got every rat in town
together and said,

332
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:36,630
show your hands if
any of them actually
seen the Pin,

333
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:37,963
you'd get a crowd
of full pockets.

334
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:40,633
You think the Pin's
just a tale to take
whatever heat?

335
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:43,553
Hmm.
But what's first?

336
00:31:45,138 --> 00:31:47,057
Show of hands.

337
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:56,190
Hello, Brendan, are you
here for the show?
No.

338
00:31:56,191 --> 00:31:58,651
Well, then could you
go then, honey, 'cause
I have this headache.

339
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:01,904
Try smoking
like a chimney.
I've heard that helps.

340
00:32:01,905 --> 00:32:04,241
Hey, isn't this
Dode's brand?

341
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:07,576
You don't know
Dode's brand.

342
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,620
Mm, I do now.

343
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:11,205
I'm gonna start
shaking things up.

344
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:13,749
Give me the story,
you might miss
the bite.

345
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,042
The story about what?

346
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:17,128
All right.
The story about what?

347
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,588
I don't wanna play games
if you've got a headache.

348
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:20,714
Get me if you
wanna spill it,

349
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:22,716
but I can't
guarantee safe passage
after tonight.

350
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:26,387
I don't know what--
Tell the Pin that Brad
was my calling card...

351
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:28,180
and I need words.

352
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:30,016
Brad Bramish?

353
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:33,435
Tail Kara at lunch.

354
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:35,187
She's got rehearsal,
but she'll blow early.

355
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:39,191
She goes home, drop her.
Else, wait for my call.

356
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:41,194
Will do.

357
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:44,196
I mean, am I crazy? Huh?

358
00:32:44,197 --> 00:32:47,199
This is all
I am trying to say here!

359
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,326
Okay, if you put me
in the game,

360
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:53,872
Brad Bramish
is gonna do what needs
to be done, baby. Okay?

361
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:55,207
But they don't
put me in,

362
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:58,168
what needs doing
ain't gonna get done!

363
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:01,130
Huh? And then don't
come crying to me--

364
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:02,965
"Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo
hoo-hoo"--

365
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:05,175
if you don't put me
in the game!

366
00:33:05,176 --> 00:33:08,596
Now am I right?
Of course I'm right!

367
00:33:08,597 --> 00:33:11,015
And don't come to me
if you don't let me play!

368
00:33:11,016 --> 00:33:13,018
- They didn't.
- Shut up!

369
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,567
What are you
doing here?

370
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:23,694
Just listening.

371
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:28,198
All right,
you got me.

372
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,658
I'm a scout
for the Gophers.

373
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:31,160
Been watching your game
for a month,

374
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:33,203
but that story right there
just clinched it!

375
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:36,750
You got heart, kid.
How soon can you be
in Minneapolis?

376
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:38,084
Yeah?

377
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:41,170
Cold winters, but they got
a great public transit system.

378
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:42,463
Yeah?

379
00:33:42,464 --> 00:33:43,423
Yeah.

380
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:44,174
Oh, yeah?

381
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:46,467
There's a thesaurus
in the library.

382
00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:49,178
"Yeah" is under "Y."
Go ahead. I'll wait.

383
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:50,596
Yo, who invited you?

384
00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:52,973
To the parking lot?

385
00:33:52,974 --> 00:33:54,224
Gee, I guess
I invited myself.

386
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:59,189
Maybe you wanna go
somewhere more private.

387
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:01,900
With you?
Mm.

388
00:34:02,525 --> 00:34:04,361
Sure.

389
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:16,122
This boy knows
what's good for him,
he'll just beat it.

390
00:34:16,206 --> 00:34:19,208
Whoopin' this small fry's butt
ain't gonna help me none.

391
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:21,711
Sure ain't gonna
help him neither.

392
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:32,097
Come on, Brad!

393
00:35:09,884 --> 00:35:12,512
Hey, is there a fight?
Yeah.

394
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:24,606
You're quite a pill.
Uh-huh.

395
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:27,235
Where are you going?
Home.

396
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:29,987
Why did you
take a powder
the other night?

397
00:35:29,988 --> 00:35:32,281
Same reason
I'm taking one now.

398
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:33,199
Hold it.

399
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,786
I want to help you.
Go away!

400
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,208
Look,
I can't trust you.

401
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:44,209
You ought to be smart
enough to know that.

402
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,964
I didn't shake up the party
to get your attention, and I'm
not heeling you to hook you.

403
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:50,174
Your connections
could help me,

404
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:54,887
but the bad baggage
they bring would make it
zero-sum gain or even hurt me.

405
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:56,430
Better off coming
at it clean.

406
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:58,348
I wouldn't have to
lead you in by the hand.

407
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:00,726
I... can't...
trust... you.

408
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:01,769
Brad was a sap.
You weren't.

409
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,855
You're with him,
so you're playing him.
So you're a player.

410
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:09,193
With you behind me,
I'd have to tie one eye up
watching both of your hands.

411
00:36:09,194 --> 00:36:11,196
I can't spare it.

412
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:13,197
You're not Brad.

413
00:36:13,198 --> 00:36:15,742
No, I'm not.

414
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:19,661
<i>You didn't call.</i>
Sorry.

415
00:36:19,662 --> 00:36:20,871
Kara went home though,
didn't she?

416
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:22,831
<i>Yeah, but she stopped at a pay phone and made two calls...</i>

417
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:25,168
that she didn't want
<i>on her phone bill.</i>
Get the numbers?

418
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,543
<i>No, sorry.</i>
It's all right.

419
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:27,544
Me and Brad
front page news?

420
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:29,838
<i>All the buzz.</i>
<i>You really do them?</i>
Yeah.

421
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,924
<i>Why, is Brad the Pin?</i>
Brad? He's a sap!

422
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:33,383
I downed him on his field
and his crew didn't bite.

423
00:36:33,384 --> 00:36:37,179
Now I know he's a sap,
and anyone who acts like
he isn't is profiting by it.

424
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,306
That's not why
I roughed him though.
<i>For kicks?</i>

425
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:41,350
Economics.
Brad's the school's
biggest Jake buyer,

426
00:36:41,351 --> 00:36:44,186
so if this Pin is
behind all the selling,
I got his attention.

427
00:36:44,187 --> 00:36:48,982
Anyway, now we've shaken
the tree. Let's wait and see
what falls on our heads.

428
00:36:48,983 --> 00:36:50,485
<i>Will do.</i>

429
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:04,206
So you didn't
know this boy?

430
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:06,416
No, sir. Never seen him.

431
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:08,168
Hmm. And he just
hit you?

432
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:10,879
Like I said, he asked
for my lunch money first.

433
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,633
Good thing
I brown-bagged it.

434
00:37:14,676 --> 00:37:17,261
Okay, Brendan,
I've been looking
to talk to you.

435
00:37:17,262 --> 00:37:20,097
You've helped
this office out before.

436
00:37:20,098 --> 00:37:23,225
No, I gave you Jerr
to see him eaten,

437
00:37:23,226 --> 00:37:25,270
not to see you fed.

438
00:37:25,562 --> 00:37:28,522
Fine.
Very well put.

439
00:37:28,523 --> 00:37:31,191
Accelerated English.
Mrs. Kasprzyk.

440
00:37:31,192 --> 00:37:34,487
- Tough teacher.
- Tough but fair.

441
00:37:35,697 --> 00:37:36,989
Okay.

442
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,200
We know you're clean.

443
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,995
And you've--

444
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:47,082
Despite your motives,
you've always been
an asset to this office.

445
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,168
And you're a good kid.

446
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:55,173
I want to run
some names past you.

447
00:37:55,174 --> 00:37:56,800
Hold it.
We're not done here.

448
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:58,051
I was done here
three months ago.

449
00:37:58,052 --> 00:37:59,720
I told you then I'd give
you Jerr and that was that.

450
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:03,181
- I'm not your inside line
and I'm not your boy.
- That's not very helpful.

451
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:06,268
You know what I'm in
if the wrong yegg saw me
pulled in here?

452
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:09,813
- What are you in?
- No.

453
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:11,189
And no more of these
informal chats either.

454
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,234
You got a discipline issue
with me, write me up
or suspend me...

455
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:17,070
and I'll see you
at the parent conference.

456
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:18,155
Hold on!

457
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:21,617
I could write you up
for talking back to a V.P....

458
00:38:21,618 --> 00:38:25,079
and for looking at me
in that threatening way.

459
00:38:25,204 --> 00:38:28,874
I would exercise
a little tact, Mr. Frye.

460
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,292
You can't pull
a stunt like that...

461
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:33,503
unless there's something
I need you for.

462
00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:35,298
So is there?

463
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:38,008
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

464
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:41,179
Maybe there's something
you need from me.

465
00:38:42,513 --> 00:38:44,307
Maybe.

466
00:38:45,934 --> 00:38:49,686
All right, I need you
off my back completely
for the next few weeks.

467
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:51,063
There might be
some heat soon.

468
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:53,815
If it's something
I can't cover, I won't
go to bat for you.

469
00:38:53,816 --> 00:38:56,026
If I get caught like that,
it's curtains anyway.

470
00:38:56,027 --> 00:38:58,654
I can't have brass
cutting me favors in public.

471
00:38:58,655 --> 00:38:59,572
I'm just letting
you know now...

472
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:04,202
so you don't come
kicking in my homeroom door
once trouble starts.

473
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:07,705
Okay.

474
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:09,706
Okay, here's
what I can do.

475
00:39:09,707 --> 00:39:12,168
I won't pin you
for anything you
aren't caught at.

476
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,796
But if anything comes up
with your prints on it,
I can't help you.

477
00:39:15,797 --> 00:39:18,382
Also, if I get
to the bottom
of whatever this is...

478
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:21,510
and it gets too hot,
and you don't deliver,

479
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:24,179
Veep's gonna need
someone to turn over,

480
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,182
police-wise.

481
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:27,808
And I'll have you.

482
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:32,187
So there better be
some meat at the end of this
like you say.

483
00:39:32,188 --> 00:39:34,816
Or at least
a fall guy.

484
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:37,193
Or you're it.

485
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:41,196
<i>Nope, Dode is M.I.A.</i>

486
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:44,366
I'm nine of 10 that Kara's
got him, but who knows where?

487
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:45,826
I shook but she's
not spilling.

488
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:47,744
<i>No more job offers,
so she's gotta play.</i>

489
00:39:47,745 --> 00:39:49,746
I know enough about Kara
to let that worry me.

490
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:51,748
All right, keep your specs
on for him. Any other news?

491
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:55,378
<i>Some. Laura Dannon</i>
<i>came to me looking</i>
<i>for you.</i>

492
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:58,171
She did, huh?
<i>Fourth period.</i>

493
00:39:58,172 --> 00:39:59,339
<i>Nearly shook me
upside down.</i>

494
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,216
Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but why'd she come to me?

495
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:04,886
She's tapping Kara,
and Kara knows you know me. Well, she's some piece of work.

496
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:08,181
<i>If I had known</i>
<i>where you were,</i>
<i>I might have told her.</i>

497
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:09,976
That's the spirit.

498
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:12,185
Ask around for Dode,
tail Kara again at lunch.

499
00:40:12,186 --> 00:40:14,730
I've got knives in my eyes.
I'm going home sick.

500
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:17,025
Call you tonight.
<i>All right.</i>

501
00:41:31,432 --> 00:41:34,185
I want
to see the Pin.

502
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:15,161
I want
to see the Pin.

503
00:43:17,496 --> 00:43:19,665
I guess you do.

504
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:06,188
You the Pin?

505
00:45:23,205 --> 00:45:24,999
Yeah.

506
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:33,173
So now I'm very, very curious
what you're gonna say next.

507
00:45:33,174 --> 00:45:36,092
Maybe I'll just sit here
and bleed at you.

508
00:45:36,093 --> 00:45:39,179
Hell, if you're
gonna go breaking
my best clients' noses...

509
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,765
and expect me
to play sandbag.

510
00:45:41,766 --> 00:45:45,185
Anyway, you've been
sniffing me out
before then.

511
00:45:45,186 --> 00:45:47,270
Sniffing for me
like a vampire bat...

512
00:45:47,271 --> 00:45:51,567
for a horse
with a nick on its ear
that he can suck on.

513
00:45:52,193 --> 00:45:54,070
They do that.

514
00:45:55,112 --> 00:45:58,199
So now you got Tugger
to bring you in,

515
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,243
which he never does.

516
00:46:03,162 --> 00:46:05,830
And you got me
listening.

517
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:08,167
So I'm very curious
what you have to say...

518
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:10,127
that better be
really, really good.

519
00:46:10,169 --> 00:46:15,174
Why don't you call Ms. Dannon
in from the hall first.
She oughta hear this.

520
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:19,177
No dice, soldier.

521
00:46:19,178 --> 00:46:22,055
Would have been
a neat trick though.

522
00:46:22,056 --> 00:46:24,182
I was just gonna come up
with some bit of information...

523
00:46:24,183 --> 00:46:27,477
or set up some phony deal,
anything so you'd let me walk.

524
00:46:27,478 --> 00:46:29,145
Then I was gonna go
to the vice principal...

525
00:46:29,146 --> 00:46:33,191
and spill him the street address
of the biggest dope port
in the burg.

526
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:35,193
- He knows zippo.
- 1250 Vista Blanca.

527
00:46:35,194 --> 00:46:38,196
The ink blotter
on the desk, in the den
in the basement...

528
00:46:38,197 --> 00:46:41,075
of the house
with the tacky mailbox.

529
00:46:43,744 --> 00:46:46,288
You gonna do what now?

530
00:46:48,332 --> 00:46:50,334
No good, soldier.

531
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,004
All right, Tug,
enough.

532
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:57,299
- Tug!
- Tug, stop!

533
00:47:17,194 --> 00:47:19,196
My glasses?

534
00:47:23,117 --> 00:47:26,203
To hell with you then.
Which wall is the door in?

535
00:47:47,224 --> 00:47:49,184
Sorry about this, kid.

536
00:47:49,185 --> 00:47:52,395
But what the hell
with what you said before?

537
00:47:52,396 --> 00:47:57,775
Where you were at,
with all of us
and Tug a fist away,

538
00:47:57,776 --> 00:48:00,278
you gotta use
your nut.

539
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:02,406
Allay the situation.

540
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:08,996
So yeah, you're not
scared of me,

541
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:10,914
I got it.

542
00:48:10,915 --> 00:48:14,834
But I'm also thinking
you're a little nuts now,

543
00:48:14,835 --> 00:48:18,422
so you've got that trade-off
with your situation.

544
00:48:19,006 --> 00:48:21,675
But nuts isn't all bad.

545
00:48:23,135 --> 00:48:25,888
So maybe it was
a good play.

546
00:48:27,056 --> 00:48:28,974
I don't know.

547
00:48:30,684 --> 00:48:33,187
So Laura
talked me down.

548
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:37,233
Why don't we
take you upstairs,

549
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:39,400
back with the living.

550
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:44,113
I thought we had
orange juice, Brendan.
I'm sorry.

551
00:48:44,114 --> 00:48:45,198
How about some Tang?

552
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:46,824
No, that's more
like soda, isn't it?

553
00:48:46,825 --> 00:48:49,202
Water's fine, ma'am,
thanks.
Oh, wait a minute.

554
00:48:49,203 --> 00:48:51,287
We have apple juice here
if you'd like that.

555
00:48:51,288 --> 00:48:54,499
Or we've got milk,
but you're having that
on your corn flakes.

556
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,210
Apple juice sounds terrific.
It's country style.

557
00:48:57,211 --> 00:49:01,214
- That's perfect.
- And I'll even give it to you
in a little country glass.

558
00:49:01,215 --> 00:49:05,218
How 'bout that?

559
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:08,597
Boys?
I'm fine Mrs. M.

560
00:49:09,223 --> 00:49:11,182
Thanks, Mom.
Mmm.

561
00:49:11,183 --> 00:49:13,268
Okay, well,

562
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:16,187
I'm gonna go, uh,

563
00:49:16,188 --> 00:49:18,983
do something
in the other room.

564
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:27,949
So, how 'bouts we
take another snap
at hearing your tale?

565
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:29,867
I don't know.
It starts out
same as before,

566
00:49:29,868 --> 00:49:31,119
and this floor
ain't carpeted.

567
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,913
- We're cooled off.
- Your muscle seemed
plenty cool...

568
00:49:33,914 --> 00:49:35,999
putting his fist
in my head.

569
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,419
I want him out.

570
00:49:39,169 --> 00:49:39,920
Lookee, soldier--

571
00:49:39,921 --> 00:49:42,297
- The ape blows or I clam.
- So clam!

572
00:49:42,298 --> 00:49:47,177
What have you got
I can't beat out of you
back in the basement?

573
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,146
Give us
a few minutes, Tug.

574
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,901
I'll call you
if whatever.

575
00:50:15,497 --> 00:50:17,291
So?

576
00:50:18,917 --> 00:50:22,837
About a year ago, I had
a small-time dealing partnership
with Jerr Madison.

577
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:25,632
- Know him?
- Till he took
the fall for you.

578
00:50:25,633 --> 00:50:27,175
Yeah, well,
I didn't ask him to,

579
00:50:27,176 --> 00:50:32,305
but he was a straight player,
and I got out clean, almost.

580
00:50:32,306 --> 00:50:36,059
Nothing on my official record,
but the V.P.'s play it
like I owe 'em one.

581
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,771
When I made it clear
I wasn't gonna be playing
their hound dog,

582
00:50:39,772 --> 00:50:40,772
well, they didn't
like it.

583
00:50:40,773 --> 00:50:43,191
They keep badgering me
and calling me in.

584
00:50:43,192 --> 00:50:44,400
Gee, that's tough.

585
00:50:44,401 --> 00:50:47,571
I don't like being told
whose side I'm on.

586
00:50:48,197 --> 00:50:51,032
So now they think
I'm on your trail.

587
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:56,205
I'm in a nice spot
to know their movements,
feed them yours.

588
00:50:56,288 --> 00:51:00,209
- I got you.
- You haven't got me yet.

589
00:51:01,085 --> 00:51:02,293
What, price?

590
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:05,004
Considering the benefits
my services could yield,

591
00:51:05,005 --> 00:51:06,422
I don't think
that's unreasonable.

592
00:51:06,423 --> 00:51:09,218
And what are
your services exactly?

593
00:51:09,635 --> 00:51:12,762
So I can be specific
on the invoice.

594
00:51:12,763 --> 00:51:16,183
Whatever serves
your interests.

595
00:51:19,103 --> 00:51:21,063
Fair enough.

596
00:51:22,189 --> 00:51:24,190
I'll have my boys
check your tale.

597
00:51:24,191 --> 00:51:26,901
And seeing how it
stretches,

598
00:51:26,902 --> 00:51:29,571
we'll either rub
or hire you.

599
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,367
You'll know which
by the end of the day
tomorrow.

600
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:42,584
We're done.

601
00:51:44,378 --> 00:51:46,422
I'll drive you back.

602
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:50,175
Just drop me
at school.

603
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:54,679
How long was I out?

604
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,763
Half an hour.

605
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:59,351
Took all of it for me
to cool the Pin down.

606
00:52:02,104 --> 00:52:03,981
Thanks.

607
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,780
Do you trust me now?

608
00:52:24,835 --> 00:52:27,670
Less now than when I
didn't trust you before.

609
00:52:27,671 --> 00:52:30,757
Maybe if you can tell me
your angle in all this
I could.

610
00:52:30,758 --> 00:52:33,760
Emily tried to get
with Brad and I about--

611
00:52:33,761 --> 00:52:35,178
Three months ago,
and you stonewalled her.

612
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:39,641
Oh, all right,
if you've already got
the world's address.

613
00:52:42,269 --> 00:52:43,978
Three months ago.

614
00:52:43,979 --> 00:52:46,522
And I liked her.
But she wasn't us
and it didn't work.

615
00:52:46,523 --> 00:52:49,901
And when she left,
she took some
souvenirs with her,

616
00:52:49,902 --> 00:52:52,153
dirty habits she wasn't
strong enough to control...

617
00:52:52,154 --> 00:52:54,197
and a connection
to the Pin
to keep them going.

618
00:52:54,198 --> 00:52:56,616
A few months pass,
and the next I hear
the Pin's raging...

619
00:52:56,617 --> 00:53:00,203
over a certain situation
with the junk
Em's partial to.

620
00:53:00,204 --> 00:53:01,913
And it's all coming down
on her head.

621
00:53:01,914 --> 00:53:03,706
You're saying Em
scraped the junk off the Pin?

622
00:53:03,707 --> 00:53:06,460
I don't care how hard
she was hooked,
I don't buy that.

623
00:53:06,502 --> 00:53:10,589
You weren't there.
She wasn't herself.
It had dug deep.

624
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,924
It was awful.

625
00:53:12,925 --> 00:53:14,133
Whether she scraped
or copped...

626
00:53:14,134 --> 00:53:17,637
or just ran her tab
around the world
and into her own back,

627
00:53:17,638 --> 00:53:20,014
must've been grand.

628
00:53:20,015 --> 00:53:22,683
Never seen
the Pin so hot.

629
00:53:22,684 --> 00:53:23,768
And when he thought
his precious--

630
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:28,273
his bricks of
whatever it was, when
one of them was missing...

631
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:30,525
he scared me.

632
00:53:30,526 --> 00:53:34,446
Why are you
telling me all this?
What's your play?

633
00:53:35,781 --> 00:53:38,200
You think
nobody sees you.

634
00:53:39,201 --> 00:53:41,244
Eating lunch
behind the portables,

635
00:53:41,245 --> 00:53:46,542
loving some girl
like she's all there is,
anywhere, to you.

636
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:50,503
I always seen you.

637
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:53,214
Or maybe
I liked Emily.

638
00:53:53,215 --> 00:53:57,218
Maybe I see what you're
trying to do for her.

639
00:53:57,219 --> 00:53:59,888
Trying to help her.

640
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:04,393
And I don't know anybody
who would do that for me.

641
00:54:05,227 --> 00:54:08,188
Now you are dangerous.

642
00:54:16,572 --> 00:54:18,823
Mr. Shanlan, should I
actually kiss her here?

643
00:54:18,824 --> 00:54:22,661
No, no, just move on
to the next scene.

644
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:29,667
Brendan, Brendan, Brendan.

645
00:54:29,668 --> 00:54:31,836
Where's Dode flopped?

646
00:54:31,837 --> 00:54:34,005
I know you two
are cozed up,

647
00:54:34,006 --> 00:54:35,715
so you tell me
or you won't.

648
00:54:35,716 --> 00:54:38,343
Now, last time
I checked...

649
00:54:39,803 --> 00:54:41,178
you were giving me
ultimatums.

650
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:44,599
It worked.
You went to Laura,
told her my tale.

651
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,644
- Part of the plan?
- Turned out to be.

652
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:51,188
I just feel
so cheap and used.

653
00:54:51,189 --> 00:54:53,190
Gol, I must seem
a real cad.

654
00:54:53,191 --> 00:54:55,610
Sometimes
I just hate myself.

655
00:54:55,611 --> 00:54:57,612
Whatever happened
to us, Brendan?

656
00:54:57,613 --> 00:54:58,988
Where's Dode flopped?

657
00:54:58,989 --> 00:55:01,825
We used to be
a pair and a half.

658
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,370
Sometimes I miss having
someone to talk to.

659
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:11,043
Do you ever miss
having someone
to talk to?

660
00:55:11,752 --> 00:55:13,587
Oh, yeah.

661
00:55:14,171 --> 00:55:15,338
You must.

662
00:55:15,339 --> 00:55:19,383
I need to hear Dode's tale
about Emily. It's important.

663
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:24,180
You better be sure
you wanna know
what you wanna know.

664
00:55:26,183 --> 00:55:28,225
Laura's working
with me now,

665
00:55:28,226 --> 00:55:30,394
and I'll have the Pin
and Tug in my corner soon.

666
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:35,191
The sooner I get the truth
from Dode or the truth
about Dode from you,

667
00:55:35,192 --> 00:55:38,277
- the safer
you'll both be.
- Hmm.

668
00:55:38,278 --> 00:55:40,446
No?
Then pass it on
to Dode anyway.

669
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:45,368
Maybe he'll have the sense
to get out from under you
before he gets hurt.

670
00:55:45,369 --> 00:55:47,245
You didn't.

671
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,873
Did you?

672
00:55:50,624 --> 00:55:54,044
<i>Dode and Kara are shacked up, but what's their play?</i>

673
00:55:54,086 --> 00:55:57,171
I don't know.
Dode passed Emily the note.

674
00:55:57,172 --> 00:55:58,172
He knows something.

675
00:55:58,173 --> 00:56:01,425
Now Kara's got him
under her thumb,
she's gonna use him somehow.

676
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:03,678
But I don't know
and I don't know,

677
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:06,180
so all we can do is wait
till she shows some cards.

678
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:11,936
Anyway, tomorrow we see
if the Pin hires me
or breaks my knees.

679
00:56:11,937 --> 00:56:13,020
Give us 70-30.

680
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:16,190
If we're in,
I get under his skin
and see what's what.

681
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:20,277
You stick to Kara,
keep your specs
peeled for Dode.

682
00:56:20,278 --> 00:56:21,779
And stay away
from Laura.

683
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,073
<i>I think she's
with us, Brendan.</i>

684
00:56:24,074 --> 00:56:26,200
I'll let you know when she is.

685
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:28,203
<i>Okay.</i>

686
00:57:10,996 --> 00:57:13,999
You the Pin's?

687
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,420
What's his answer?

688
00:57:42,402 --> 00:57:45,571
Push 'em back!
Push 'em back! Way back!

689
00:57:45,572 --> 00:57:49,743
Push 'em back!
Push 'em back!
Way back!

690
00:58:50,846 --> 00:58:52,346
Chuck Burns.

691
00:58:52,347 --> 00:58:54,056
Long-haired lug,
deals, shines a blade.

692
00:58:54,057 --> 00:58:56,225
<i>I know him, I just can't
pin him to any crowd.</i>

693
00:58:56,226 --> 00:58:57,935
<i>He's definitely not
muscle for anyone.</i>

694
00:58:57,936 --> 00:58:59,687
He taps the Carrow's crowd, but doesn't hang with them.

695
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:02,189
<i>- If you've got a guess,</i>
<i>I could check it out.</i>
- He's with the Pin.

696
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:04,233
Everything's kablooey,
and I gotta blow the burg.

697
00:59:04,234 --> 00:59:07,195
I'll check it out and--

698
00:59:07,946 --> 00:59:12,826
Never mind.
If I don't call by 3:00,
call in the bulls.

699
00:59:33,597 --> 00:59:35,307
So?

700
00:59:36,808 --> 00:59:38,727
So.

701
00:59:43,773 --> 00:59:46,734
That's what you'll get
every week for your services.

702
00:59:46,735 --> 00:59:49,153
Unless of course there's
some specific job,

703
00:59:49,154 --> 00:59:52,156
in which you'll get
sliced in with my crew.

704
00:59:52,157 --> 00:59:53,949
- Square?
- Yeah.

705
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:57,494
We're doing a thing
tonight down at The Hole.

706
00:59:57,495 --> 00:59:58,413
Know it?

707
00:59:58,414 --> 01:00:00,331
South of
T Street. Yeah.

708
01:00:00,332 --> 01:00:03,418
It's a little
"welcome-you-in" thing.

709
01:00:04,169 --> 01:00:06,004
6:00.

710
01:00:33,782 --> 01:00:38,369
<i>I know what you did.
I was in the tunnel.</i>

711
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,537
<i>I saw you hide her.</i>

712
01:00:40,538 --> 01:00:44,458
- Dode.
<i>- Anyone I tell, it would ruin you some way,</i>

713
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:46,460
<i>and I'm gonna
tell someone.</i>

714
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:49,338
Are you making an offer?
<i>Maybe.</i>

715
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:51,215
<i>Or maybe
I'll just do you in.</i>

716
01:00:51,216 --> 01:00:53,175
Hire another hash-head
to blade me?

717
01:00:53,176 --> 01:00:54,927
<i>Don't need
no blade, shamus.</i>

718
01:00:54,928 --> 01:00:57,638
<i>- I just gotta squawk.</i>
- What do you want?

719
01:00:57,639 --> 01:01:01,393
<i>Just to see you sweat.</i>

720
01:01:12,404 --> 01:01:14,738
<i>Brendan?</i>

721
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:16,491
Brain.

722
01:01:19,035 --> 01:01:22,497
<i>Are you all right?</i>

723
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:29,169
So I'm gonna start you
on the dope circles.

724
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:32,172
Anyway, there's
not much else doing.

725
01:01:32,173 --> 01:01:35,092
I'm tailing out
this big deal,
but it's almost done.

726
01:01:35,093 --> 01:01:38,178
Oh, yeah,
what was it?

727
01:01:38,179 --> 01:01:41,682
It was big-time.
Biggest I ever done.

728
01:01:41,683 --> 01:01:46,186
And there was a snag
in it, but it's
almost done now.

729
01:01:46,187 --> 01:01:47,187
What was it?

730
01:01:47,188 --> 01:01:51,192
You're going
to make me curious
being so curious.

731
01:01:54,195 --> 01:01:56,906
I wanna lay
something out.

732
01:02:01,202 --> 01:02:04,038
You're coming into
a certain situation,

733
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:08,167
and I'm sort of
bringing you in
because of it.

734
01:02:08,168 --> 01:02:11,670
I didn't tell Tug
to hit you for
the Brad Bramish thing.

735
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:14,591
He got hot and
he just hit you.

736
01:02:15,175 --> 01:02:18,678
He's been doing that.
Yeah?

737
01:02:20,013 --> 01:02:20,680
Yeah.

738
01:02:20,681 --> 01:02:23,474
Muscle you can't
control's no good
at that.

739
01:02:23,475 --> 01:02:28,188
You're working for me,
not for Tug. That's all.

740
01:02:29,856 --> 01:02:31,691
All right.

741
01:02:33,193 --> 01:02:35,194
It's tough sometimes.

742
01:02:35,195 --> 01:02:39,199
It's twisted, complicated.

743
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:41,910
I don't know.

744
01:02:43,203 --> 01:02:45,455
Everyone's got
their thing.

745
01:02:47,665 --> 01:02:50,585
You read Tolkien?
What?

746
01:02:51,044 --> 01:02:53,713
You know,
the Hobbit books?

747
01:02:54,506 --> 01:02:56,216
Yeah.

748
01:02:57,217 --> 01:03:01,221
His descriptions
of things
are really good.

749
01:03:05,475 --> 01:03:09,562
Oh, yeah,
he makes you want
to be there.

750
01:03:33,169 --> 01:03:34,837
<i>Don't go to class.</i>
What?

751
01:03:34,838 --> 01:03:39,091
<i>Fifth period,</i>
<i>Trueman and the V.P.</i>
<i>come in asking for you.</i>

752
01:03:39,092 --> 01:03:42,177
<i>Did they call your mom?</i>
Probably.
I got in late.

753
01:03:42,178 --> 01:03:43,470
<i>Get out
of there too, then.</i>

754
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:45,180
Meet me behind the library. I've got stuff.

755
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:48,183
Frisco Farr was
found on a sidewalk...

756
01:03:48,184 --> 01:03:49,601
three weeks ago outside
of Pinkerton's Deli.

757
01:03:49,602 --> 01:03:52,896
He was in a coma.
His stomach contained
a sausage sandwich,

758
01:03:52,897 --> 01:03:56,525
a horse dose
of heroin and traces
of choleric tricemate,

759
01:03:56,526 --> 01:03:59,945
which is a poisonous chemical
found in laundry detergent.

760
01:03:59,946 --> 01:04:01,488
He's still under,
nobody's talking,

761
01:04:01,489 --> 01:04:02,739
- so nothing's
come of it.
- O.D.?

762
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:05,868
No. The chem the junk
must've been cut with
put him down.

763
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:10,205
Bad junk, "bad brick."
Could that form of heroin
be called "brick"?

764
01:04:10,206 --> 01:04:11,373
It was
a concentrated powder.

765
01:04:11,374 --> 01:04:15,545
Its street handle
is "whip," "rock"
or "Brock."

766
01:04:16,421 --> 01:04:17,754
From Laura.

767
01:04:17,755 --> 01:04:19,173
I told you
to stay clear
of Laura.

768
01:04:19,174 --> 01:04:23,344
- You tell her
to stay clear of me?
- I gotta get voice mail.

769
01:04:26,473 --> 01:04:30,184
No, tell her I'll be
at the Pin's at 1:00.

770
01:04:30,185 --> 01:04:32,478
Any news
with the lug?

771
01:04:32,479 --> 01:04:35,315
No, no news.

772
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,198
This isn't good.

773
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:46,075
No.

774
01:04:50,288 --> 01:04:52,457
Ask.

775
01:04:56,878 --> 01:04:58,295
Administration.

776
01:04:58,296 --> 01:05:00,548
Gary Trueman's office,
please.

777
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:02,675
This is Trueman.

778
01:05:02,676 --> 01:05:05,093
What the hell are you doing
asking for me in class?

779
01:05:05,094 --> 01:05:07,346
<i>What the hell are you
doing out of class?</i>

780
01:05:07,347 --> 01:05:08,555
What?
<i>The V.P. and I...</i>

781
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:11,808
<i>needed to ask you</i>
<i>a few questions</i>
<i>about Emily Kostich,</i>

782
01:05:11,809 --> 01:05:13,560
<i>who you might
have heard is missing.</i>

783
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:18,190
It's a very serious thing. The police are involved.

784
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:19,983
<i>The V.P. and I knew
you two were close.</i>

785
01:05:19,984 --> 01:05:25,990
<i>So the V.P. and I came</i>
<i>to ask you questions,</i>
<i>but you were truant--</i>

786
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,201
- What?
- Been cut loose.
Not safe here.

787
01:05:29,202 --> 01:05:33,497
We shouldn't have met
in the open. Lay low, but ask
on the underneath for Dode.

788
01:05:33,498 --> 01:05:35,374
He set up
whatever Emily
walked into.

789
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:36,834
It's getting
more urgent
that we talk.

790
01:05:36,876 --> 01:05:39,753
- What are you gonna do?
- I'd have liked
to play it safe,

791
01:05:39,754 --> 01:05:40,713
but there's no time.

792
01:05:40,714 --> 01:05:42,172
The Pin's not
letting anything drop.

793
01:05:42,173 --> 01:05:43,924
Have to
push things a bit.
How?

794
01:05:43,925 --> 01:05:48,179
- I don't know.
- Find Dode.

795
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:20,640
What with the poking, genius?
Maybe you're poking
for your bull friends?

796
01:09:20,641 --> 01:09:23,393
I can't face up at school,
the V.P.'s so hot for me!

797
01:09:23,394 --> 01:09:25,103
Maybe you're looking
to make good!

798
01:09:25,104 --> 01:09:26,730
I'm looking to find
this big game
the Pin's played.

799
01:09:26,731 --> 01:09:29,691
Not to gum it,
but just so when its tail
jams in my back,

800
01:09:29,692 --> 01:09:30,817
I know who to bill
for the embalming!

801
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:34,863
- You ought to ask him
what you wanna know.
- I did. He didn't tell me.

802
01:09:34,864 --> 01:09:39,201
The Pin's not
giving me the straight.
That makes me nervous.

803
01:09:39,202 --> 01:09:41,204
Makes me angry.

804
01:09:42,205 --> 01:09:45,208
Yeah.

805
01:09:48,169 --> 01:09:50,171
That's understandable.

806
01:09:53,925 --> 01:09:55,175
There was 10 of them.

807
01:09:55,176 --> 01:09:57,177
I don't know
where he picked them,
he didn't tell me.

808
01:09:57,178 --> 01:09:59,888
Huh.
So we get
10 kilos of Brock.

809
01:09:59,889 --> 01:10:01,932
Ain't enough marks
in the whole burg
to eat that,

810
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:05,811
so he unloads eight up north,
even up to the docks.

811
01:10:05,812 --> 01:10:07,020
I don't know who.

812
01:10:07,021 --> 01:10:10,190
- Didn't tell you.
- Yeah.

813
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:13,151
That was eight.
So that's the tenth
in there.

814
01:10:13,152 --> 01:10:15,487
We gotta break it off
into doses.

815
01:10:15,488 --> 01:10:18,865
Sell off around the high,
maybe some by Shorecliffs.

816
01:10:18,866 --> 01:10:21,160
What about
the ninth brick?

817
01:10:21,786 --> 01:10:24,705
Yeah, there were
some problems with that.

818
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:27,415
Oh, yeah?

819
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:29,417
It, uh--

820
01:10:29,418 --> 01:10:33,171
It, uh, disappeared.

821
01:10:33,172 --> 01:10:34,464
Someone skimmed it.

822
01:10:34,465 --> 01:10:37,384
We started raising hell
with all the likely suspects,

823
01:10:37,385 --> 01:10:40,221
and what do you know,
it came back.

824
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:42,180
But it came back bad.

825
01:10:42,181 --> 01:10:45,183
One of ours took
a dose off the top,

826
01:10:45,184 --> 01:10:46,685
laid him out.

827
01:10:46,686 --> 01:10:48,019
Frisco?

828
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,731
Yeah, poor Frisco.

829
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,734
You heard about that?

830
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:56,278
We'll catch the rat.

831
01:10:56,279 --> 01:10:58,614
Just takes time.

832
01:10:58,823 --> 01:11:02,451
I heard something fell
with Emily Kostich.

833
01:11:04,203 --> 01:11:06,205
Emily who?

834
01:11:06,831 --> 01:11:08,666
Kostich?

835
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:12,169
Don't know her.

836
01:11:18,759 --> 01:11:22,346
Has the Pin talked about her?
Not to me.

837
01:11:25,266 --> 01:11:27,601
He might know something.

838
01:11:27,602 --> 01:11:29,185
Ask him.

839
01:11:29,186 --> 01:11:30,687
Tell me what he says,
'cause...

840
01:11:30,688 --> 01:11:36,319
you know,
if he heard something,
I wanna check.

841
01:11:37,194 --> 01:11:38,988
Sure.

842
01:11:47,204 --> 01:11:48,872
Powwowing?

843
01:11:48,873 --> 01:11:50,874
Just shootin' the shat.

844
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:52,250
Yeah, just shootin' it.

845
01:11:52,251 --> 01:11:54,169
Good.

846
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:55,545
Tug, I got a call...

847
01:11:55,546 --> 01:11:59,842
from someone who says
they know something
about Emily.

848
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:06,389
Emily?
Emily Kostich.

849
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:09,184
Where she's at now.

850
01:12:09,185 --> 01:12:12,145
Says we'd wanna know.
Wants to meet.

851
01:12:12,146 --> 01:12:13,480
Yeah?

852
01:12:13,481 --> 01:12:17,193
So we'll meet.
4:00.

853
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:21,989
Emily used to be
Tug's girl.

854
01:12:23,074 --> 01:12:26,326
You knew Emily,
didn't you?
A while back.

855
01:12:26,327 --> 01:12:28,662
You've heard
she's missing?

856
01:12:28,663 --> 01:12:29,913
I heard that.

857
01:12:29,914 --> 01:12:32,540
So maybe you wanna
come along too.

858
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:34,668
What does Emily
got to do with you?

859
01:12:34,669 --> 01:12:38,172
Show. Maybe we'll
find out.

860
01:12:39,924 --> 01:12:41,759
4:00.

861
01:12:46,305 --> 01:12:48,349
That's my ride.

862
01:12:49,225 --> 01:12:51,352
4:00.

863
01:12:58,734 --> 01:13:01,237
Pay phone,
anywhere.

864
01:13:02,947 --> 01:13:07,201
<i>The mobile customer you've called is not available.</i>

865
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:22,257
What time is it?
Brendan, you probably--

866
01:13:22,258 --> 01:13:24,217
What time is it?
3:40!

867
01:13:24,218 --> 01:13:27,178
You're exhausted.
You've swallowed
a lot of blood.

868
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:28,179
Get back
in the car.
Shut up!

869
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:31,683
You need to go to the
hospital. You're sick!
Shut up, please! Please!

870
01:13:31,684 --> 01:13:35,186
Okay, what you gotta do
is drive around
in the pie house lot...

871
01:13:35,187 --> 01:13:37,981
so Dode's gotta go by
you or me to get down
to the tunnel.

872
01:13:37,982 --> 01:13:43,194
If you see Dode,
then honk four times,
long-short, long-short.

873
01:13:43,195 --> 01:13:45,572
And don't be seen.
Get back in the car.

874
01:13:45,573 --> 01:13:47,199
Do it!

875
01:13:47,867 --> 01:13:51,369
Please?
I need you to do this.

876
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:54,206
I need you here.

877
01:13:54,999 --> 01:13:56,584
Please.

878
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:29,491
- What are you doing, Dode?
- You gonna stop me?

879
01:14:29,492 --> 01:14:32,202
- What do you think
you're doing?
- I saw what you did.

880
01:14:32,203 --> 01:14:33,203
- What did you see?
- I saw you.

881
01:14:33,204 --> 01:14:36,247
- Where?
- I was in the tunnel!
I saw you!

882
01:14:36,248 --> 01:14:38,584
You were with her dead,
and you took the body!

883
01:14:38,626 --> 01:14:40,168
I saw you hide it!
Yeah, I did.

884
01:14:40,169 --> 01:14:42,212
That's all you saw?
What about before?

885
01:14:42,213 --> 01:14:43,505
- Before what?
- Before I got there.

886
01:14:43,506 --> 01:14:45,173
- Did you see
who killed her?
- You killed her!

887
01:14:45,174 --> 01:14:48,593
- I found the body, Dode.
- No, you-- We--
I thought you didn't.

888
01:14:48,594 --> 01:14:53,014
But we figured you out.
I got the news on you
'cause you hid the body.

889
01:14:53,015 --> 01:14:54,182
- Who's we?
- Shut up! Shut up!

890
01:14:54,183 --> 01:14:56,810
You're always talkin',
always this and that!
You're gonna shut up!

891
01:14:56,811 --> 01:14:58,520
- I didn't kill her.
- You're not gonna talk!

892
01:14:58,521 --> 01:15:00,021
- I know you're thinking of Em.
- Shut up!

893
01:15:00,022 --> 01:15:03,191
I know you tried to help her.
You're gonna
shut your mouth!

894
01:15:03,192 --> 01:15:05,193
Me and Kara,
we're gonna bury you,

895
01:15:05,194 --> 01:15:07,445
and we're gonna get
paid doing it, dig?

896
01:15:07,446 --> 01:15:08,780
You're gonna put it over
real nice!

897
01:15:08,781 --> 01:15:12,033
You're in over your head.
You don't wanna put
your hand in this!

898
01:15:12,034 --> 01:15:14,077
She's dead, you--
Why was she scared?

899
01:15:14,078 --> 01:15:16,329
She came to me!
Who was she scared of?

900
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:18,206
I think I know why.
I just gotta know who!

901
01:15:18,207 --> 01:15:21,251
You're trying to confuse me!
You couldn't stand it!
Your little Em!

902
01:15:21,252 --> 01:15:25,548
She was gonna keep it.
It was mine,
and you couldn't stand that!

903
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,137
What was yours?

904
01:15:32,138 --> 01:15:35,182
- I had you pegged.
- What was yours?

905
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:41,981
I loved her...
and I would have
loved that kid.

906
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,612
I'm gonna bury you.

907
01:16:52,176 --> 01:16:54,178
What'd I miss?

908
01:16:58,474 --> 01:17:02,311
Dode here says
Emily Kostich is dead.

909
01:17:05,314 --> 01:17:07,191
Oh, yeah?

910
01:17:08,484 --> 01:17:11,195
He says he knows
who did it.

911
01:17:16,742 --> 01:17:19,745
Says he knows where the body is.

912
01:17:28,087 --> 01:17:32,508
Says he wants
more money than I think
the information is worth.

913
01:17:35,552 --> 01:17:38,180
That so,
Dode?

914
01:17:39,765 --> 01:17:42,850
So walk.
What's the info have
to do with you anyways?

915
01:17:42,851 --> 01:17:45,186
- Plenty.
- "Plenty," he says.

916
01:17:45,187 --> 01:17:46,980
Uh-huh. And he wants cash
on the nail.

917
01:17:46,981 --> 01:17:49,983
He's a pot-skulled
reef-worm with more hop
in his head than blood.

918
01:17:49,984 --> 01:17:53,069
- Why pay for dirt
you can't believe?
- No, you'll believe this.

919
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:56,030
Maybe you will.
No, you will.

920
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:58,950
'Cause it's someone
close to you, real close.

921
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:00,535
Maybe it's hot,
but it's Dode.

922
01:18:00,536 --> 01:18:04,456
- You can't trust it.
- Real close.

923
01:18:17,344 --> 01:18:19,595
I'm getting
my shoes wet for this?

924
01:18:19,596 --> 01:18:23,100
- Let him milk you if you want.
- - Stay.

925
01:18:23,183 --> 01:18:24,851
It's still too much.

926
01:18:24,852 --> 01:18:27,186
No, it isn't.
You won't complain
when you hear it.

927
01:18:27,187 --> 01:18:30,148
- Maybe you should--
- You had her up against
the wall with the brick.

928
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:32,150
I know my business.
It's still too much.

929
01:18:32,151 --> 01:18:36,238
No, it isn't 'cause
that's not why she was killed.

930
01:18:36,655 --> 01:18:38,197
But it's real
important to you,

931
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:43,536
'cause the person
who killed her is real close,
'cause he's got a lot to lose.

932
01:18:43,537 --> 01:18:47,165
And he knows if I don't bury him
by spilling to you,

933
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:50,418
I spill to the bulls
and I bury him for real.

934
01:18:50,419 --> 01:18:53,672
And he's really,
really scared.

935
01:18:56,675 --> 01:19:01,513
She had a kid in her,
and he couldn't stand it!

936
01:19:07,811 --> 01:19:10,564
- Tug, it's all right!
- Tug, stop!

937
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:22,659
Tug!

938
01:19:47,726 --> 01:19:49,436
Tug.

939
01:20:30,686 --> 01:20:34,064
She sprung it
on me just--

940
01:20:40,779 --> 01:20:44,074
It's a hell of a thing
to spring on a guy.

941
01:20:47,202 --> 01:20:49,788
I don't remember much.

942
01:20:50,789 --> 01:20:54,168
Laura talked me
down after.

943
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:56,752
Said whatever--

944
01:20:56,753 --> 01:21:00,174
She knew her,
said it wasn't true.

945
01:21:04,344 --> 01:21:07,181
But I still
think sometimes--

946
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:12,686
I think...
about it being true.

947
01:21:16,398 --> 01:21:19,067
About it being mine.

948
01:21:23,197 --> 01:21:25,199
Maybe I did it...

949
01:21:25,532 --> 01:21:28,202
'cause I thought
it was true.

950
01:21:33,248 --> 01:21:35,959
It's a hell of a thing.

951
01:21:44,468 --> 01:21:45,718
You up?

952
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:47,178
What's the stats?

953
01:21:47,179 --> 01:21:50,140
Everyone's just laying low.

954
01:21:50,599 --> 01:21:54,186
You're here with us now
at my folks' place.

955
01:21:55,395 --> 01:21:58,190
Everyone's
assuming it's war.

956
01:22:00,067 --> 01:22:03,069
No one's said
anything yet.

957
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:05,280
Everyone's laying low.

958
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:07,866
At war?

959
01:22:08,033 --> 01:22:12,037
- You're with us.
- The hell I am.

960
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:19,169
All right,
I'm with you.

961
01:22:19,962 --> 01:22:22,171
Just lie low.

962
01:22:22,172 --> 01:22:24,174
Sleep some more.

963
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:27,386
Laura, she said
you should sleep.

964
01:22:41,191 --> 01:22:45,862
<i>Stupid? Hey, Huxley,
I'm back!</i>

965
01:22:46,029 --> 01:22:47,822
<i>Brendan?</i>
Yeah.

966
01:22:47,823 --> 01:22:49,782
Are you-- What? Man, have you heard about Dode?

967
01:22:49,783 --> 01:22:52,535
I was there.
Where were you yesterday?
I called.

968
01:22:52,536 --> 01:22:54,287
Kasprzyk took my phone, turned it off.

969
01:22:54,288 --> 01:22:56,747
<i>I just now got it back.</i>
All right, listen.

970
01:22:56,748 --> 01:22:58,333
<i>Are you okay?</i>
Just listen.

971
01:22:58,375 --> 01:23:01,002
Is my name in the papers
with the story? No.

972
01:23:01,003 --> 01:23:03,963
Is it just Dode's name
in the papers? Yeah. What do you mean?

973
01:23:03,964 --> 01:23:07,174
Listen, I'm gonna be
calling you tonight,
probably late.

974
01:23:07,175 --> 01:23:10,303
Sleep with your phone on.
Could you get a car
if you needed to?

975
01:23:10,304 --> 01:23:13,014
If it's late enough, I could take my mom's.

976
01:23:13,015 --> 01:23:15,892
Be ready then.
I'll call.

977
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,186
Brendan, did you hear
about Dode?

978
01:23:19,187 --> 01:23:21,897
You scheming tramp.
You set that poor kid up.

979
01:23:21,898 --> 01:23:26,193
You held Dode like a card
till you could play him.
For money!

980
01:23:26,194 --> 01:23:28,237
I don't know what
you're talking about.

981
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:30,573
You'd bury me at the same time,
but it was mostly for the money!

982
01:23:30,574 --> 01:23:34,201
You got Dode thinking Em
had his kid, thinking I did it,
and that was enough for him.

983
01:23:34,202 --> 01:23:36,579
But he stuck to the money
'cause you had your claws
in him!

984
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:40,291
'Cause he couldn't
come away from the deal
without it and make you happy!

985
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:43,669
Brendan, I think you need
to sit down for a second.

986
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:45,212
I think you're just
a mess right now.

987
01:23:45,213 --> 01:23:50,927
Can you please, sweetheart,
can you go run and get
my shoes from the locker room?

988
01:23:58,685 --> 01:24:02,522
Still wish you knew
what you wanted to know?

989
01:24:05,192 --> 01:24:07,777
You know, if it's any
consolation, it probably
wasn't Dode's kid.

990
01:24:07,778 --> 01:24:11,030
It might have been Tug's kid.
Frankly, I wouldn't bet a horse.

991
01:24:11,031 --> 01:24:16,244
It was kind of a crowded field
there at the end,
if you know what I mean.

992
01:24:29,758 --> 01:24:31,885
Meanie.

993
01:24:35,806 --> 01:24:38,265
Aaah!
What are you doing?

994
01:24:38,266 --> 01:24:40,102
Showing your ace!

995
01:24:40,185 --> 01:24:42,229
Far enough.

996
01:24:43,438 --> 01:24:45,648
Everyone's paying
social calls.

997
01:24:45,649 --> 01:24:47,900
So, what are
the stats?

998
01:24:47,901 --> 01:24:50,111
- The stats are war.
- Tug got hot.
He panicked.

999
01:24:50,112 --> 01:24:53,197
- Tug's been after my digs
from the get-go.
- No, he's been anxious.

1000
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:56,742
He thought if you found out
he killed Emily,
you'd turn him over.

1001
01:24:56,743 --> 01:24:58,202
- He was right.
- Yeah, well.

1002
01:24:58,203 --> 01:25:02,873
I told him to get
the straight, no roughing.
I wasn't even there.

1003
01:25:02,874 --> 01:25:03,750
All right,
so he's a hothead.

1004
01:25:03,792 --> 01:25:08,087
You don't want him on your side.
Let's have a powwow before
we start digging trenches.

1005
01:25:08,088 --> 01:25:11,174
Maybe we can all walk away
amiable enemies.

1006
01:25:12,884 --> 01:25:14,385
Yeah, all right.

1007
01:25:14,386 --> 01:25:15,720
- 4:00.
- Tomorrow?

1008
01:25:15,721 --> 01:25:19,766
Tonight. Let's clear it all
before it boils up again.

1009
01:25:20,809 --> 01:25:22,894
Wait.

1010
01:25:23,437 --> 01:25:25,480
I'll drive you back.

1011
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,900
<i>So here's the sit.</i>

1012
01:25:29,901 --> 01:25:33,195
You and the Pin
are gonna powwow tonight.
4:00, his place.

1013
01:25:33,196 --> 01:25:34,780
Bring all
the muscle you want,
you won't need it.

1014
01:25:34,781 --> 01:25:38,576
He wants to talk straight,
and you're gonna work with him
for whatever he needs.

1015
01:25:38,577 --> 01:25:40,161
- You don't want war.
- The hell I don't.

1016
01:25:40,162 --> 01:25:43,706
The Pin's sitting
on the brick profits.
Hitting him now would be post.

1017
01:25:43,707 --> 01:25:46,042
Make peace,
wait for your chance.

1018
01:25:46,084 --> 01:25:48,420
He's right, Tug.
Smooth it out.

1019
01:25:49,838 --> 01:25:52,006
Besides, he's got you
on the Dode thing.

1020
01:25:52,007 --> 01:25:56,094
War will mean you versus him
and every bull in the burg.

1021
01:25:57,053 --> 01:25:59,055
Yeah, we'll talk.

1022
01:25:59,765 --> 01:26:01,808
You going?
Yeah.

1023
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:24,664
Go away.

1024
01:26:44,351 --> 01:26:46,436
I'm sorry,
Brendan.

1025
01:27:01,868 --> 01:27:03,870
I'm so sorry.

1026
01:27:55,422 --> 01:27:57,424
Don't go tonight.

1027
01:27:58,884 --> 01:28:02,261
I gotta
make sure everything
plays out smooth.

1028
01:28:02,262 --> 01:28:05,890
It'll play out
however it plays
without you there.

1029
01:28:05,891 --> 01:28:09,059
I gotta make sure.
Why?

1030
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:12,188
'Cause if there's war,
I'm in it too.

1031
01:28:18,737 --> 01:28:20,864
I'm just scared.

1032
01:28:21,364 --> 01:28:24,326
If things go bad tonight,

1033
01:28:24,784 --> 01:28:26,953
just be careful.

1034
01:29:01,196 --> 01:29:03,197
- Your folks left
the car here?
- Yeah.

1035
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:04,907
Take it and Laura's.
I'll go first in yours.

1036
01:29:04,908 --> 01:29:07,660
- The hell you'll take mine.
- The scenic route,
draw off any tailers.

1037
01:29:07,661 --> 01:29:11,205
They'll think it's you,
might even radio back
you're alone.

1038
01:29:11,206 --> 01:29:13,124
Mr. Smarts.

1039
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,918
You got a cigarette?

1040
01:29:15,919 --> 01:29:17,252
I don't smoke.

1041
01:29:17,253 --> 01:29:18,629
I've seen you smoke.

1042
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:21,424
I don't smoke
cigarettes.

1043
01:29:22,175 --> 01:29:25,053
Give me 15 minutes,
then go.

1044
01:29:25,553 --> 01:29:27,054
Write this down.

1045
01:29:27,055 --> 01:29:28,681
I'm gonna be out
of the Pin's by 4:15.

1046
01:29:28,682 --> 01:29:31,976
So at exactly 4:15,
you put an anonymous call in
to the bulls.

1047
01:29:31,977 --> 01:29:36,480
You tell them
there are drugs in the trunk
of the black Mustang...

1048
01:29:36,481 --> 01:29:37,606
outside the Pin's house.

1049
01:29:37,607 --> 01:29:39,817
- Can you get the car?
- Yeah.

1050
01:29:39,818 --> 01:29:42,444
All right,
after you call the cops,
go to Tug's house.

1051
01:29:42,445 --> 01:29:45,948
12 Elm.
Park outside and wait.
Laura's inside.

1052
01:29:45,949 --> 01:29:49,702
She hasn't got a car,
but if she blows on foot
or gets a pick,

1053
01:29:49,703 --> 01:29:51,746
tail her, all right?

1054
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:55,333
All right?
<i>Okay.</i>

1055
01:29:56,751 --> 01:29:59,170
I'll call you
when it gets light.

1056
01:30:03,425 --> 01:30:05,343
Thanks, Brain.

1057
01:31:00,482 --> 01:31:02,859
Talk.

1058
01:31:03,193 --> 01:31:08,531
I want full assurance
that any heat from Emily
and Dode is on just you.

1059
01:31:08,907 --> 01:31:12,911
I don't even want my name
pulled into this shindig.

1060
01:31:13,203 --> 01:31:15,829
Second,
you owe me six C's.

1061
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:21,293
No rush, but I want your shake
that they'll be home
in not too much time.

1062
01:31:21,294 --> 01:31:23,754
That's square.
You did him after all.

1063
01:31:23,755 --> 01:31:24,589
Lay low,
it'll blow over.

1064
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:29,927
Stick on this, one of you
will dish it to bury the other,
you'll both get the rap.

1065
01:31:29,928 --> 01:31:32,722
As for the six,
did you borrow it?

1066
01:31:32,931 --> 01:31:36,809
- Yeah.
- Then you owe it. Shouldn't
need to shake on that.

1067
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:40,479
All right to both.
Good. Let's seal it up
and blow for keeps.

1068
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,898
Third thing.

1069
01:31:42,899 --> 01:31:44,274
The last brick.

1070
01:31:44,275 --> 01:31:45,984
It's yours.

1071
01:31:45,985 --> 01:31:48,446
That's not the point.

1072
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:51,198
I'm gonna start
selling it.

1073
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:53,033
How do I know
it's not bad?

1074
01:31:53,034 --> 01:31:56,955
- Why would it be?
- Why was the last one?

1075
01:31:57,205 --> 01:31:59,958
Because someone got greedy.

1076
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:02,501
Tug here's had the means
to swipe half of it...

1077
01:32:02,502 --> 01:32:05,003
and cut it bad
for a long time.

1078
01:32:05,004 --> 01:32:06,171
Now we're splits.

1079
01:32:06,172 --> 01:32:08,507
The loss of my trust
is retroactive.

1080
01:32:08,508 --> 01:32:10,884
Did you, Tug?
No.

1081
01:32:10,885 --> 01:32:14,722
- All right,
let's shake and blow.
- Not good enough.

1082
01:32:15,181 --> 01:32:17,559
What would be
good enough?

1083
01:32:17,851 --> 01:32:20,686
I want to see him dose it...

1084
01:32:20,687 --> 01:32:22,437
just to prove it.

1085
01:32:22,438 --> 01:32:24,273
- Then we're square.
- Hell for that.

1086
01:32:24,274 --> 01:32:26,191
I didn't touch
your junk!

1087
01:32:26,192 --> 01:32:28,193
- That's all!
- I wanna see it.

1088
01:32:28,194 --> 01:32:29,903
- To hell!
- Your not wanting
to dose it...

1089
01:32:29,904 --> 01:32:33,073
- is proving something
to me right here.
- Oh, it better be.

1090
01:32:33,074 --> 01:32:35,784
It's tellin' that I ain't
under your thumb no more!

1091
01:32:35,785 --> 01:32:40,874
That I ain't playin' lapdog
to no Gothed-up cripple!

1092
01:32:43,168 --> 01:32:45,419
- I'll dose it.
- What?

1093
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:48,046
If it will shut
you two apes up,
I'll take the dose.

1094
01:32:48,047 --> 01:32:51,050
If I don't die,
we're all right as rain.

1095
01:32:51,718 --> 01:32:53,595
Deal?

1096
01:32:55,221 --> 01:32:57,307
Fine.

1097
01:32:58,516 --> 01:33:00,142
Tangles.

1098
01:33:00,143 --> 01:33:02,228
Johnny,
go with him.

1099
01:33:14,741 --> 01:33:17,492
Where is it? Where's the brick?
What's happening?

1100
01:33:17,493 --> 01:33:19,870
- What'd you do with it?
- I didn't touch your brick!

1101
01:33:19,871 --> 01:33:23,124
You better give it back.

1102
01:34:06,626 --> 01:34:08,543
What's happening?
Cops?

1103
01:34:08,544 --> 01:34:12,798
No.
The brick--

1104
01:34:12,799 --> 01:34:15,176
The brick is gone.

1105
01:34:16,594 --> 01:34:19,721
Make peace, huh?
Talk it out?

1106
01:34:19,722 --> 01:34:22,683
Get your boys in my den
so you could snag it
under my nose!

1107
01:34:22,684 --> 01:34:24,184
No, all right?
It's not that!

1108
01:34:24,185 --> 01:34:25,103
Was it bad, Tug?

1109
01:34:25,104 --> 01:34:27,688
Snag it so I don't know,
or sell it off to flat
the war odds!

1110
01:34:27,689 --> 01:34:30,566
Pin, think about it!
I did all of that!

1111
01:34:32,402 --> 01:34:33,987
Tug, no!

1112
01:34:44,706 --> 01:34:46,165
Brendan!

1113
01:34:46,207 --> 01:34:47,207
No!

1114
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:53,673
Help me! Uh!

1115
01:34:54,841 --> 01:34:58,885
No! No!

1116
01:34:58,886 --> 01:35:01,180
Brendan, please!

1117
01:35:03,182 --> 01:35:05,351
Stop!

1118
01:35:15,194 --> 01:35:18,197
Please, help me!

1119
01:35:18,614 --> 01:35:21,616
It's the cops!

1120
01:35:21,617 --> 01:35:24,120
- Cops!
- Help me!

1121
01:35:24,495 --> 01:35:27,164
Brendan, please!

1122
01:35:27,165 --> 01:35:29,083
Please!

1123
01:36:00,490 --> 01:36:03,700
- Hey, where are you?
- Library. Where are you?

1124
01:36:03,701 --> 01:36:04,701
Did she blow last night?

1125
01:36:04,702 --> 01:36:08,164
<i>No, stayed there till 6:30,
then walked to school.</i>

1126
01:36:08,206 --> 01:36:10,041
You didn't give her
a ride, did you?

1127
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:13,210
<i>No.</i>
She came to school
straight from Tug's?

1128
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:14,586
<i>Yeah.</i>
She there now?

1129
01:36:14,587 --> 01:36:16,171
<i>Yeah. Not with me,
but here.</i>

1130
01:36:16,172 --> 01:36:20,008
All right, tell her
I want to meet up on the
field in half an hour.

1131
01:36:20,009 --> 01:36:23,178
Then go home,
get some sleep.

1132
01:36:23,179 --> 01:36:25,098
<i>Will do.</i>

1133
01:37:12,854 --> 01:37:17,483
Did you see it all?
With the Pin and Tug?

1134
01:37:20,027 --> 01:37:23,197
No, I took your advice
and didn't go.

1135
01:37:25,408 --> 01:37:27,201
No?

1136
01:37:28,202 --> 01:37:30,204
What happened?

1137
01:37:30,705 --> 01:37:33,166
The papers say six dead.

1138
01:37:33,207 --> 01:37:34,791
Three around the house,

1139
01:37:34,792 --> 01:37:38,921
girl in the back of Tug's car,
and the Pin and Tug.

1140
01:37:40,131 --> 01:37:40,673
Yeah?

1141
01:37:40,674 --> 01:37:45,553
Tug tried
to shoot his way out
when the police got there.

1142
01:37:46,012 --> 01:37:47,804
They tied him to Dode too.

1143
01:37:47,805 --> 01:37:50,766
Same gun.
And the girl.

1144
01:37:55,855 --> 01:37:59,065
It's a good thing
you weren't there.

1145
01:37:59,066 --> 01:38:00,818
Yeah.

1146
01:38:02,778 --> 01:38:05,615
Do you think
the girl is Emily?

1147
01:38:08,201 --> 01:38:09,702
Probably.

1148
01:38:14,624 --> 01:38:16,709
You loved her?

1149
01:38:18,461 --> 01:38:20,338
Yeah, I did.

1150
01:38:20,505 --> 01:38:23,924
You did all of this
because you loved her.

1151
01:38:23,925 --> 01:38:26,677
And now it's finished.

1152
01:38:28,429 --> 01:38:30,181
No.

1153
01:38:32,183 --> 01:38:34,184
What?

1154
01:38:34,185 --> 01:38:36,186
It's not finished.

1155
01:38:36,187 --> 01:38:39,189
Tug pulled
the trigger on Em,
and he got the fall for it,

1156
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:42,400
but the bulls could have
found that out without me.

1157
01:38:42,401 --> 01:38:44,945
I set out to know
who put her in the spot,

1158
01:38:44,946 --> 01:38:47,698
who put her
in front of the gun.

1159
01:38:48,491 --> 01:38:51,410
That was you, angel.

1160
01:38:51,911 --> 01:38:54,997
What are you talking about?

1161
01:38:55,665 --> 01:38:57,291
It was you.

1162
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:03,548
- Brendan.
- What?

1163
01:39:04,674 --> 01:39:08,177
You want the whole tale?
You want me to tell it to you?

1164
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:11,180
Tell it to me.

1165
01:39:14,141 --> 01:39:17,186
All right,
from the top.

1166
01:39:18,521 --> 01:39:21,189
You had your fingers
in Brad Bramish
for appearances...

1167
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:25,193
and to keep him
buying from the Pin,
who you were hooked with.

1168
01:39:25,194 --> 01:39:27,195
When Emily came
to you and Brad,

1169
01:39:27,196 --> 01:39:28,905
you saw her
for what she was,

1170
01:39:28,906 --> 01:39:31,950
an insecure little girl
trying to get in.

1171
01:39:31,951 --> 01:39:34,704
She goes on
the back burner.

1172
01:39:34,996 --> 01:39:37,832
Meanwhile,
maybe you're getting bored,
maybe just greedy,

1173
01:39:37,873 --> 01:39:40,959
but when the Pin scores
big with the bricks,
you take your shot.

1174
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,295
You hook one, take half,
cut it back to size,

1175
01:39:43,296 --> 01:39:44,421
but you cut it back bad.

1176
01:39:44,422 --> 01:39:48,800
Maybe accidentally, maybe to
down the Pin's operation,
doesn't matter.

1177
01:39:48,801 --> 01:39:50,010
You put it back.

1178
01:39:50,011 --> 01:39:53,972
Poor Frisco doses off it
and lands in a coma.

1179
01:39:53,973 --> 01:39:54,724
So now the Pin's fuming.

1180
01:39:54,725 --> 01:39:58,727
Maybe he's jealous of Brad,
so he comes to Brad's crowd
looking for blood,

1181
01:39:58,728 --> 01:39:59,687
or at least a scape'.

1182
01:39:59,688 --> 01:40:03,482
You're in big trouble.
There's gonna be
a war over this.

1183
01:40:04,108 --> 01:40:05,442
And there's Emily.

1184
01:40:05,443 --> 01:40:08,403
She trusts you.
She wants in.

1185
01:40:08,404 --> 01:40:10,196
- It's duck soup.
- No!

1186
01:40:10,197 --> 01:40:12,449
You frame her
for the bad brick,
then you cut her loose.

1187
01:40:12,450 --> 01:40:14,909
You turn on your heel
and bite her in the throat!

1188
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:17,203
Last week at the pay phone,
Del Rio and Sarmentoso,

1189
01:40:17,204 --> 01:40:18,830
she saw something
she was scared of.

1190
01:40:18,831 --> 01:40:21,166
Tug's car driving by,
the Pin riding shotgun.

1191
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:23,001
But she wouldn't
have seen the Pin.

1192
01:40:23,002 --> 01:40:24,461
No, she was across
the street, angel.

1193
01:40:24,462 --> 01:40:28,006
She saw the driver's side.
She saw you.

1194
01:40:28,007 --> 01:40:31,217
She saw you
and she ran like
she saw some devil.

1195
01:40:31,218 --> 01:40:33,178
Brendan, she was--
She took the hit.

1196
01:40:33,179 --> 01:40:34,763
Dode hid her away,
but the Pin was onto her.

1197
01:40:34,764 --> 01:40:37,307
He tracked her down
and told her to meet,
that they'd make good.

1198
01:40:37,308 --> 01:40:40,685
He gave her a time
and a place and sent Tug
to get the straight.

1199
01:40:40,686 --> 01:40:43,063
But maybe you had
talked Tug up.

1200
01:40:43,064 --> 01:40:44,189
Or maybe
he just blew a fuse.

1201
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:46,191
But when Em sprung it
on him she had her kid,

1202
01:40:46,192 --> 01:40:49,778
he did what anyone
could count on
Tug doing:

1203
01:40:49,779 --> 01:40:50,613
He hit her.

1204
01:40:50,614 --> 01:40:54,199
She took the hit for you,
and you let her take it.

1205
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,575
- Stop! Stop it!
- That's the tale.

1206
01:40:55,576 --> 01:40:58,788
- Tell me it's not.
- Stop it! No!

1207
01:41:05,169 --> 01:41:09,048
- Then tell me it's not.
- It's not.

1208
01:41:14,178 --> 01:41:16,347
It isn't true.

1209
01:41:18,808 --> 01:41:21,185
I hope it isn't.

1210
01:41:21,977 --> 01:41:25,606
I want you to have been
on my side all along.

1211
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:29,317
Not just trying to get me
under your thumb...

1212
01:41:29,318 --> 01:41:33,197
like Brad,
and the Pin and Tug.

1213
01:41:33,489 --> 01:41:36,199
But I think you knew
that party was gonna
blow up.

1214
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,203
I think that was
your final play.

1215
01:41:40,204 --> 01:41:42,790
But I hope I'm wrong.

1216
01:41:43,916 --> 01:41:45,542
I hope everything
I wrote in the note...

1217
01:41:45,543 --> 01:41:49,587
that I dropped
at Gary Trueman's office
this morning is wrong,

1218
01:41:49,588 --> 01:41:54,802
about your
and Brad's involvement
in the Pin's runnings.

1219
01:41:55,428 --> 01:41:59,556
And I hope you didn't steal
the brick last night...

1220
01:41:59,557 --> 01:42:01,684
in your purse.

1221
01:42:02,309 --> 01:42:04,228
I didn't.

1222
01:42:05,104 --> 01:42:06,439
Good.

1223
01:42:06,647 --> 01:42:10,442
That means you
didn't let me walk
into a slaughterhouse.

1224
01:42:10,443 --> 01:42:15,448
And you didn't lead the Pin
and Tug and their crews
to the slaughter.

1225
01:42:16,198 --> 01:42:17,991
And when Trueman
reads my note,

1226
01:42:17,992 --> 01:42:20,953
takes my cue and
searches your locker,

1227
01:42:21,245 --> 01:42:24,540
he won't find
a damn thing.

1228
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:41,140
Oh, Brendan,

1229
01:42:42,183 --> 01:42:44,185
don't do this.

1230
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:51,525
It's done.

1231
01:42:52,651 --> 01:42:55,029
Done?

1232
01:43:00,493 --> 01:43:03,995
Well, that's most of it.

1233
01:43:03,996 --> 01:43:06,332
Nine out of 10.

1234
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:10,920
I told Em
to tell Tug it was his.

1235
01:43:11,545 --> 01:43:14,298
Told her it would
soften him up.

1236
01:43:15,466 --> 01:43:19,093
Sh-- She said she wished
she could keep it,

1237
01:43:19,094 --> 01:43:21,972
but she didn't love
the father.

1238
01:43:22,431 --> 01:43:26,352
I was gonna drive her
down to the doctor
the next day.

1239
01:43:27,102 --> 01:43:29,103
Most wouldn't.

1240
01:43:29,104 --> 01:43:31,982
She was already
starting to show.

1241
01:43:33,442 --> 01:43:35,444
Three months.

1242
01:43:36,987 --> 01:43:40,241
Do you know whose kid
that makes it?

1243
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:43,994
Or have you known
all along?

1244
01:43:46,747 --> 01:43:48,666
Mother--

1245
01:44:09,478 --> 01:44:11,062
You get your straight?

1246
01:44:11,063 --> 01:44:13,314
Yeah.
I wouldn't have,
if I, uh--

1247
01:44:13,315 --> 01:44:15,276
It's all right.

1248
01:44:15,693 --> 01:44:17,902
Chuck Burns came to.

1249
01:44:17,903 --> 01:44:20,196
Knife guy.
Spilled it all to the bulls.

1250
01:44:20,197 --> 01:44:22,782
Turns out Brad Bramish
hired him on his own.

1251
01:44:22,783 --> 01:44:26,662
It was just
a grudge thing.
Fits.

1252
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:31,166
You did good, Brain.
Go sleep.

1253
01:44:31,625 --> 01:44:34,044
Yeah, you too.

1254
01:44:40,843 --> 01:44:43,679
What'd she
whisper to you?

1255
01:44:47,391 --> 01:44:49,935
She called me
a dirty word.

1256
01:44:51,604 --> 01:44:54,607
All right,
you don't have
to tell me.
