1
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:10,104
I sent you 20 letters
from Paris last year.

2
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:12,356
Well, you've been gone six months.

3
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,233
And I got the fear.

4
00:01:14,316 --> 00:01:17,820
After all the songs
that we've sung together.

5
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:20,906
After all the sweet
and all the stormy...

6
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:26,620
if I knew where you were.

7
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:28,831
Well, I would surely inform you that...

8
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,545
But every night don't you.

9
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,629
Sleep on your right?

10
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:37,381
Don't you...

11
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:42,678
Hey, Ash, where are we?

12
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:44,972
Well, we just crossed
the Tennessee border.

13
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:54,064
- Which would put us...
- Yeah?

14
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:01,572
Which would put us...

15
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:08,078
right...

16
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,999
here.

17
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,460
Turn!

18
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,051
What the hell was that?
Are you trying to kill us?

19
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:24,220
Hey, don't blame me!
It's your steering wheel.

20
00:02:24,303 --> 00:02:25,906
The damn thing jerked
right out of my hand!

21
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,724
I don't understand, I had this thing in
for a tune-up yesterday

22
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,118
and they said they'd go over everything.

23
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:32,370
Yeah, well, you'd better take it back
'cause the damn thing don't work.

24
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:34,688
The only thing that does work
is this lousy horn.

25
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,070
Aw, go to hell! I'm not honking at you!

26
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:46,075
Jesus Christ.

27
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:48,536
Hey, Scotty,
what's this place like anyway?

28
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,664
Well, the guy that's renting it
says it's an old place...

29
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:55,876
a little run down,
but it's right up in the mountains.

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,462
And the best part is we get it so cheap.

31
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,631
Yeah, why are we getting it so cheap?

32
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,300
Well, I don't know.
Might be in real bad shape.

33
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,970
You mean, nobody's seen this place yet?

34
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,137
Well, not yet.

35
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,349
- Well, it might not be that bad.
- No.

36
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:13,602
- Actually, it might be kinda nice.
- Yeah.

37
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:15,563
It's probably a real pit.

38
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:18,375
Hey, I think this is where we get off.

39
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:25,948
This is the bridge
we're gonna cross?

40
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,784
Jesus Christ, the whole thing's
falling apart on us!

41
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,289
Don't let the noise fool you, girls.
This thing is solid as a rock.

42
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,051
It's supposed to be one of these on here.

43
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:46,231
- Come on. Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

44
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,942
Hey.

45
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:20,784
Join us.

46
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,956
Join us...

47
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,449
Dead bodies in the cellar.

48
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,911
- Dead bodies in the cellar.
- Will you stop it?

49
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:50,582
I would like very much to make
a toast here for all this evening.

50
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,167
- Yeah.
- That sounds all right.

51
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:58,590
Uh, as a Greek friend of mine once said...

52
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:02,469
he said, "I..."

53
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:05,889
No, okay, okay, okay.

54
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:09,184
"Nis, nis...

55
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:12,854
tu... tu... tu-tar-im."

56
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:16,358
- Which means?
- "Party down." Yeah!

57
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,341
What is this?

58
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:44,469
Whatever it is, it's still down there.

59
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:48,473
I don't like cellars.
Let's just close it up.

60
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:51,268
It's probably just some animal.

61
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,229
An animal? An animal?!

62
00:10:55,605 --> 00:10:57,983
That is the stupidest thing
I ever heard of.

63
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,818
Jesus Christ.

64
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:02,529
Well, there's something down there.

65
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,783
Well, maybe it is just some animal.

66
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:11,079
Yeah, you're probably right.
It's probably just some animal.

67
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:13,182
Here, Cheryl. Why don't you go down
and check to make sure?

68
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,751
Scotty, I'm not going down there!

69
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:19,004
Okay okay, you cowards. I'll go.

70
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:20,338
Be careful.

71
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:27,304
Back in a minute.

72
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,787
Hey... hey, Scotty, you find anything?

73
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:55,665
Scotty?

74
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,671
Scotty!

75
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:08,261
Scott!

76
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,975
He's just kidding around.

77
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:18,438
- Isn't he?
- Scotty!

78
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:24,152
Scott! Linda, get me a flashlight.

79
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:25,987
Well, that's the only one we brought up.

80
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:27,114
Then get the lantern.

81
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,861
Scotty?

82
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,818
Hey, come here.
I want to show you something.

83
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:14,489
Look at all this stuff.

84
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:26,251
I bet this still shoots.

85
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:28,003
Probably does.

86
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:30,380
Oh! God!

87
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:41,933
Oh, God.

88
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:43,268
Look at this.

89
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,453
Look at this.

90
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:15,300
This kind of looks
like your old girlfriend.

91
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:20,555
Come on,
let's take this stuff upstairs.

92
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:23,141
I'll grab the recorder
and you get everything else.

93
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:24,351
Yeah, okay.

94
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,282
This guy was
a real turd, you know?

95
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,450
Everybody hated him.

96
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,869
Like you kind of, right?

97
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:45,205
Yeah, just like me.
I'm gonna break your face.

98
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:48,041
Also, he was into this Western stuff.

99
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:49,584
He makes all these little models...

100
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:53,254
Okay, shh. Listen to this.

101
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,383
This is the tape I found downstairs.

102
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,345
It has been a number of years

103
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:05,809
since I began excavating the ruins
of Ca'n Dar with a group of my colleagues.

104
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,728
Now my wife and I have
retreated to a small cabin

105
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,439
in the solitude of these mountains.

106
00:17:11,523 --> 00:17:14,150
Here I continued my research undisturbed

107
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:17,487
by the myriad distractions
of modern civilization

108
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,573
and far from the groves of academe.

109
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:25,662
I believe I have made a significant find
in the Ca'n Darian ruins:

110
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,581
A volume of ancient Sumerian
burial practices

111
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:31,251
and funerary incantations.

112
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:34,421
It is entitled Naturan Demanto.

113
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:37,424
Roughly translated... "Book of the Dead."

114
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:41,970
The book is bound in human flesh
and inked in human blood.

115
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:47,642
It deals with demons, demon resurrection,

116
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:51,563
and those forces which roam the forest
and dark bowers of man's domain.

117
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:56,901
The first few pages warn that
these enduring creatures may lie dormant,

118
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:59,821
but are never truly dead.

119
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:02,031
They may be recalled to active life

120
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,826
through the incantations
presented in this book.

121
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,662
It is through recitation of these passages

122
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:11,249
that the demons are given license
to possess the living.

123
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,312
Hey, what'd you do that for?
It was just getting good.

124
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:17,464
I just don't wanna
hear it anymore, that's all.

125
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:24,095
Scott, come on.
Leave her alone, man.

126
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,973
Hey, come on. I just wanna hear
the rest of it.

127
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:28,641
No big deal.

128
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:33,938
Tantir-ah-mis-trobeen-ha-zar-ta.

129
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:36,483
Tantir-manov-

130
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:40,028
mansis-hazen-sober.

131
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:45,700
Saman-ta-roza-dûr-hiz-hikar-
dan-derodza.

132
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:47,327
Kanda.

133
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:50,455
Shut it off.

134
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:54,042
Kanda.

135
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,044
Shut it off.

136
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,504
Kanda!

137
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:59,631
Shut it off!

138
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,591
Oh, my God!

139
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:07,931
Cheryl.

140
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,141
- Where are you going?
- I can't believe this.

141
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:13,102
Scott, you knew not to play that.

142
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,026
I mean, come on,
you knew it was upsetting her.

143
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:16,874
You just don't know when
you're taking something too far.

144
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:18,858
Hey, don't give me that.
You were playing it, too.

145
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:20,777
You could have shut it off.

146
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,489
I mean, big deal! She's nuts.

147
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:26,366
I mean, it's just a joke. Come on.

148
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:30,662
Jesus Christ, she acts like she's
three years old or something.

149
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:49,347
Listen, why don't we stay up for a while
and listen to the storm?

150
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,015
All right, yeah.

151
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,309
Let me check on Cheryl first
to make sure she's okay.

152
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,644
Okay.

153
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:02,462
Oh! Stealing from the blind, huh?

154
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:06,674
It's for you.

155
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:21,314
Ash, how sweet of you.

156
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,027
- Would you put it on?
- Oh, sure.

157
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,008
I was gonna give it to you
before we came up here,

158
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:33,951
but things got so hectic.

159
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:37,413
This is really the first chance
we've had to be alone.

160
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:42,752
Take a look.

161
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,966
Oh, Ash, it's beautiful.

162
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:53,262
I really love it. I'll never take it off.

163
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:52,655
Join us...

164
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:31,277
Is anybody out there?

165
00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:34,882
I know someone's out there.

166
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,767
I heard you. I heard you in the cellar.

167
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:25,474
Join us.

168
00:27:51,662 --> 00:27:53,205
Help!

169
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,431
Ashley!

170
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,981
Help!

171
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:02,316
The keys.

172
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,008
Help!

173
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,928
- What the hell happened to you?
- Yeah, what's the matter with you?

174
00:29:54,952 --> 00:29:56,388
Did something in the woods
do this to you?

175
00:29:56,412 --> 00:29:59,415
No, it was the woods themselves.

176
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,543
They're alive, Ashley.
The trees, they're alive!

177
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:05,171
Ash, why don't I take her
in the back room so she can lie down?

178
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:08,591
I'm not lying down!
I wanna get out of here!

179
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,759
I wanna leave this place right now.

180
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,803
- Right now, Ashley.
- Wait a minute.

181
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:14,889
I sure as hell am not leaving
any place tonight.

182
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:16,515
- Cheryl.
- Cheryl.

183
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,910
Cheryl, there's nothing out there.
Trees do not attack people.

184
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:21,395
Ashley, will you drive me
into town or not?

185
00:30:21,478 --> 00:30:23,355
What, right now?

186
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,319
Yeah. Look, sure, sure,
I'll take you into town,

187
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:28,736
- but just listen to what you're saying.
- I don't care how it sounds.

188
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:31,280
I wanna get out of this place right now.

189
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:35,284
Okay, you can stay
somewhere in town tonight.

190
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,955
Come on, come on, come on.

191
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:48,399
I know it's not gonna start.
It's not gonna let us leave.

192
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,122
Why are you stopping?

193
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,042
Wait here a minute.

194
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:00,888
Do you see something?

195
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,684
Where you going?!

196
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:10,856
Ashley?

197
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:24,703
Ashley?

198
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,600
- It's not gonna let us go!
- What?

199
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:31,562
It's not gonna let us go! I told you!

200
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:34,231
I told you, it's not gonna let us go!

201
00:34:34,314 --> 00:34:36,567
Why won't you listen to me?

202
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:55,711
I know now that my wife
has become host to a Ca'n Darian demon.

203
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:59,965
I fear that the only way to stop those
possessed by the spirits of the book

204
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:03,177
is through the act
of bodily dismemberment.

205
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,889
I would leave now to avoid this horror,
but for myself I...

206
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,892
I have seen the dark shadows
moving in the woods,

207
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:14,146
and I have no doubt that whatever
I have resurrected through this book

208
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:17,816
is sure to come calling for me.

209
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,820
Okay, let me think. Um... It's a seven.

210
00:35:21,904 --> 00:35:24,072
- What suit?
- Um... diamonds.

211
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:26,116
No, no, no, wait. Uh, hearts.

212
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,494
Oh my God. Seven of hearts, you're right.

213
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:31,163
Hey, Ash, I guessed the card right.

214
00:35:31,246 --> 00:35:33,332
Yeah, truly amazing, Linda.

215
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:34,541
I don't know, I don't know,

216
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,686
but I think it's really some sort
of extra sense or something.

217
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,670
- You know, like ESP?
- Okay, try this.

218
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:42,216
- Okay, um... it's a seven.
- I don't believe it.

219
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:46,261
Of spades... queen of spades.

220
00:35:48,055 --> 00:35:51,600
Four of hearts,

221
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,393
eight of spades,

222
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:57,314
two of spades, jack of diamonds,

223
00:35:57,397 --> 00:35:58,649
jack of clubs.

224
00:36:01,276 --> 00:36:04,613
Why have you
disturbed our sleep,

225
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:08,825
awakened us from our ancient slumber?

226
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:12,871
You will die like the others before you!

227
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:17,668
One by one, we will take you.

228
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:32,224
What happened to her?

229
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:33,976
Cheryl?

230
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:37,854
Cheryl?

231
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:43,819
Did you see her eyes?

232
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:46,405
Ash, I'm scared. What's wrong with her?

233
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,041
Cheryl, stop it!

234
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:05,359
Join us. Join us...

235
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,536
Ash, I think we ought to get out of here.

236
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,080
Yeah.

237
00:39:43,498 --> 00:39:45,500
We still have a few more hours
before morning.

238
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:48,795
I don't think I can wait that long.

239
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:52,215
You have to. We all have to.

240
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:55,427
And then in the morning,
we'll get in the car

241
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,304
and we'll take the bridge.

242
00:39:57,387 --> 00:39:59,014
And...

243
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:03,852
Why does she keep making
those horrible noises?

244
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,228
I don't know!

245
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,399
What about her eyes?

246
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:11,902
What about her eyes?

247
00:40:13,403 --> 00:40:17,783
For God's sake,
what happened to her eyes?!

248
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:33,840
Everything's gonna be all right.

249
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,321
Scotty, I... I think
there's something out there.

250
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:08,708
Go to bed and get some sleep, okay?

251
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,528
Shelly?

252
00:44:01,256 --> 00:44:04,592
No! Don't burn her! Get her out!

253
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:08,138
No!

254
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:12,809
Thank you.

255
00:44:12,892 --> 00:44:15,979
I don't know what I would have done

256
00:44:16,062 --> 00:44:20,066
if I had remained on those hot coals,

257
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,527
burning my pretty flesh.

258
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,779
You have pretty skin.

259
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:28,575
Give it to us!

260
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,049
Join us! Join us!

261
00:44:55,101 --> 00:44:57,604
Join us!

262
00:45:22,212 --> 00:45:24,464
No, no, no!

263
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:31,841
Hit her.

264
00:47:33,009 --> 00:47:34,010
Hit her!

265
00:47:35,428 --> 00:47:36,763
Hit it!

266
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,105
Let go! No, no!

267
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:48,900
You love her! No!

268
00:47:53,446 --> 00:47:56,616
No, you love her! Don't do it!

269
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:31,317
Scott?

270
00:48:33,569 --> 00:48:35,905
Yeah?

271
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:39,617
What is... what are we gonna do?

272
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,122
We're gonna bury her.

273
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:47,750
You can't bury Shelly.

274
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:50,795
- She's a... she's a friend of ours.
- Ash, she's dead.

275
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:54,966
Shelly's dead.

276
00:48:58,553 --> 00:49:00,305
We gotta bury her now.

277
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,532
Linda's still sleeping.

278
00:50:01,616 --> 00:50:03,677
- I think once her leg's...
- I'm getting out of here.

279
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,996
Scott, we can't take Linda anywhere
with her leg like that.

280
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,800
We don't even know if there is
any other way back besides the bridge.

281
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:12,502
Well, maybe there's a hiking trail,
or an old road,

282
00:50:12,585 --> 00:50:14,003
or some other way around the cliff.

283
00:50:15,254 --> 00:50:18,466
I mean, there's gotta be another way
besides the bridge.

284
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,218
Listen to me.

285
00:50:20,301 --> 00:50:23,179
Linda cannot walk with her leg like that.
She can't even stand up.

286
00:50:24,597 --> 00:50:27,767
Well, then we'll leave her here
until we can send somebody back.

287
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,060
What are you, crazy?

288
00:50:29,143 --> 00:50:30,853
- Scott...
- Look, I'm gettin' out!

289
00:50:32,438 --> 00:50:33,898
I don't care what happens to her.

290
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:37,026
She's your girlfriend.
You take care of her.

291
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,861
I'm getting the hell
out of here right now.

292
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:03,344
Soon all of you will be like me

293
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:05,638
and then we will lock you up
in the cellar!

294
00:51:58,691 --> 00:52:00,193
My God, Ash!

295
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:01,569
Ash.

296
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,779
- Oh my God.
- Help me.

297
00:52:05,531 --> 00:52:08,826
Yes, help me. Yes.

298
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:12,622
Did you fall, or what?

299
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:19,378
Scotty, you're gonna be okay.

300
00:52:19,462 --> 00:52:21,756
You're gonna be just fine, you'll see.

301
00:52:32,808 --> 00:52:35,978
Ash, it's not gonna let us leave.

302
00:52:36,062 --> 00:52:39,732
Cheryl... Cheryl was right.

303
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,362
- We're all gonna die here.
- No, we're not gonna die.

304
00:52:44,445 --> 00:52:47,865
We're all gonna die, all of us.

305
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:50,201
No, we're not gonna die.

306
00:52:50,284 --> 00:52:52,954
We're not gonna die!
We're gonna get outta here!

307
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:56,749
Now listen to me, Scotty.
Is there a way around the bridge?

308
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,502
Scotty!

309
00:52:59,585 --> 00:53:01,504
Listen to me, please! For God's sake!

310
00:53:01,587 --> 00:53:03,714
Scott!

311
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:07,009
- Come on.
- Ash...

312
00:53:07,093 --> 00:53:10,054
Ash, I don't wanna die.

313
00:53:10,137 --> 00:53:12,056
You're not gonna leave me,
are you, Ash?

314
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:14,809
- Are you?
- "I don't wanna die.

315
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,769
You're not gonna
leave me here, are you?

316
00:53:16,852 --> 00:53:19,230
Are you, Ash?"

317
00:53:21,774 --> 00:53:24,735
Scotty, now come on!
Listen to me, for God's sake!

318
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:27,613
Is there a way around the bridge?!

319
00:53:27,697 --> 00:53:30,449
There's a way... the trail.

320
00:53:31,826 --> 00:53:35,788
But the trees, Ash... they know.

321
00:53:37,373 --> 00:53:39,292
Don't you see, Ash? They're alive.

322
00:53:51,804 --> 00:53:54,181
Shut up! Shut up, Linda!

323
00:53:59,854 --> 00:54:01,856
Shut up!

324
00:54:16,662 --> 00:54:19,915
Kill her. Kill her!

325
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:23,294
Kill her if you can, lover boy!

326
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:33,054
God forgive me, Linda.

327
00:54:57,912 --> 00:55:00,748
Oh, Ash... help me, please!

328
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:06,921
Ash?

329
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:10,091
Help me, please, Ash.

330
00:55:11,092 --> 00:55:15,429
Oh, Ash, please don't let them
take me away again.

331
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:16,514
- Please.
- No, I won't.

332
00:55:16,597 --> 00:55:19,517
- Please.
- I won't, I promise.

333
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,270
Ashley. Ashley, help me.

334
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:24,605
Let me out of here.

335
00:55:25,606 --> 00:55:29,360
Ashley? Ash, help me.

336
00:55:29,443 --> 00:55:33,114
Let me out of here.
I'm... I'm all right now.

337
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:35,157
I'm all right now, Ashley.

338
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:36,534
I'm all right.

339
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:41,122
Unlock this chain and let me out.

340
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:50,297
Cheryl?

341
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:25,249
Cheryl?

342
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,383
I'm all right now, Ashley.

343
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:36,594
Come unlock the chain and let me out!

344
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:39,805
I'm all right now.

345
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:41,307
It's your sister Cheryl.

346
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:51,317
Oh, you bastards!

347
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,319
Why are you torturing me like this?

348
00:56:53,402 --> 00:56:56,572
Why?!

349
00:57:04,705 --> 00:57:06,123
Shut up.

350
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,272
Useless. Useless.

351
00:57:30,356 --> 00:57:34,735
In time we'll come for him,
and then we'll come for you.

352
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,471
Here. Here.

353
00:58:03,889 --> 00:58:07,017
Now the sun will be up
in an hour or so,

354
00:58:07,101 --> 00:58:09,478
and we can all get out of here together...

355
00:58:09,562 --> 00:58:12,731
you, me, Linda, Shelly.

356
00:58:15,901 --> 00:58:18,779
No, not Shelly. She...

357
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:24,118
We'll all be going home together.

358
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,601
Wouldn't you like to be going home?

359
00:58:27,121 --> 00:58:29,081
I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?

360
00:58:33,794 --> 00:58:36,714
Scott?

361
00:59:40,235 --> 00:59:43,739
Join us. Join us.

362
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:11,053
Oh, Linda.

363
01:06:22,554 --> 01:06:25,057
Come to me.

364
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:43,367
Come on, get off.

365
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:32,434
- Oh, God.
- Help, Ashley. Ashley!

366
01:08:33,685 --> 01:08:34,853
The door.

367
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:58,919
The back door.

368
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:10,138
Shells... where did I see
that box of shells?

369
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:52,365
We're gonna get you.

370
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:55,744
- We're gonna get you.
- Shut up, Linda.

371
01:10:55,827 --> 01:10:58,913
- We're all gonna die.
- Shut up!

372
01:10:58,997 --> 01:11:00,540
- All of us!
- Shut up.

373
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:04,252
- Ash, how sweet of you.
- God forgive me, Linda.

374
01:11:04,336 --> 01:11:07,005
...through the act
of bodily dismemberment.

375
01:11:07,088 --> 01:11:09,090
- Hit her.
- I really love it.

376
01:11:09,174 --> 01:11:10,925
- Hit her.
- I'll never take it off.

377
01:11:11,009 --> 01:11:12,302
Hit it.

378
01:14:18,071 --> 01:14:19,697
No!

379
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:47,851
Oh, God...

380
01:14:53,314 --> 01:14:54,649
There it is!

381
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,992
Come on, come on.
Why are you torturing me like this?

382
01:15:18,006 --> 01:15:19,757
It's nothing, man.

383
01:15:50,747 --> 01:15:52,248
Linda.

384
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:13,978
Join us! Ashley, join us!

385
01:18:14,932 --> 01:18:17,435
Must die.

386
01:19:51,654 --> 01:19:53,364
No.

387
01:21:22,662 --> 01:21:25,414
No, no, no! Oh, God!

388
01:21:41,722 --> 01:21:43,391
Join us.

389
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:48,187
Join us.

390
01:21:50,147 --> 01:21:52,650
Join us...
