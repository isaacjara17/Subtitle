1
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,541
- Whoo!

2
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:04,999
Senor.

3
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:23,541
Uh, you folks American citizens?

4
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:26,916
- I am. Yes.
- Where were you born, miss?

5
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,166
- Missus.
- What?

6
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:31,999
- Philadelphia.
- The name is Vargas.

7
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,499
Hey, Jim! You see who's here?

8
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,832
Sure. Mr. Vargas.
Hot on the trail of another dope ring?

9
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,749
Hot on the trail of
a chocolate soda for my wife.

10
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,666
- Your wife?
- Barely a bride, Officer.

11
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:45,332
- Hey, can I get through?

12
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:47,749
Lot of talk up here about how
you cracked that Grandi business.

13
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,249
- What?
- Yeah, we hear you caught the big boss.

14
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,791
No, only one of them.
The Grandis are a big family.

15
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:54,207
- Good night.
- Good night.

16
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:56,249
- No purchases, Mr. Linnekar?
- Hey.

17
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,249
- Hey, I've got this--
- You an American citizen, miss?

18
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,707
- I got this ticking noise.
- Yeah, okay.

19
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:01,957
- No, really.
- Good night.

20
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:03,624
This ticking noise in my head.

21
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,166
Mike, do you realize this is
the very first time we've been together

22
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:12,874
in my country?

23
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,041
Do you realize I haven't kissed you
in over an hour?

24
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:28,124
<i>- ¿Qué pasó?</i>
- <i>No sé. Un carro explotó.</i>

25
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,874
- Mike, what happened?
- That car that just passed us exploded.

26
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,832
The car? How could it do that?

27
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,249
I don't know.
I'll have to try to find out.

28
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,332
You'd better not come any closer.
There's--

29
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,207
We'll have to postpone
that soda, I'm afraid.

30
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:49,749
- But, Mike, couldn't I--
- Susie, please be careful.

31
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,332
This could be very bad for us.

32
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,832
- For us?
- For Mexico, I mean.

33
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:01,082
Anyway, there's nothing
I can do over here.

34
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:02,249
So?

35
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,166
So I'll try not to be too long.

36
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,666
Go on, darling. You wait at the hotel.

37
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,999
Blaine, I thought you
were back in Washington.

38
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,416
I leave tomorrow. You know Schwartz
of the local DA's office.

39
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:21,249
- How do you do, sir?
- Hi.

40
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,124
Can you tell me who's in charge here?

41
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,791
I can't even tell you what happened.

42
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,374
Why aren't you back in Mexico City?
Isn't that dope trial coming up?

43
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,582
Grandi? It's Thursday.

44
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:31,249
I'd hoped to go back on
the morning plane, but now--

45
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,374
- You mean this business.
- I'm afraid so.

46
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,374
That bomb came from
the Mexican side of the border.

47
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,832
- The car did.
- Wow.

48
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:02,666
Lady, he says you don't
understand what he wants.

49
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:05,082
I understand very well what he wants.

50
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:08,541
- He save your life, lady.
- Tell him I'm a married woman...

51
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:12,082
and that my husband is
a great big official in the government,

52
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,332
ready and willing to knock out
all those pretty front teeth of his.

53
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:18,124
That's it, lady. Your husband.

54
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,874
That's what he wants
to talk to you about.

55
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,916
"Follow this boy at once.

56
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:29,749
We have something
very important for Mr. Vargas."

57
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,749
Well, what have I got to lose?

58
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,916
Don't answer that. Lead on, Pancho.

59
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,416
Across the border again? Hmm.

60
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,291
Hey, Doc, here comes the DA.

61
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,874
- Come on. Stand back.

62
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,874
Where's Captain Quinlan?
Got him out of bed at his ranch.

63
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,041
He's on his way.

64
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,124
Old Hank must be the only one in
the county who didn't hear the explosion.

65
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:03,291
Terrible thing, isn't it?

66
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,166
Has the, uh, daughter been told?

67
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,041
They're bringing her over right now--

68
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:09,166
- That's right.
- ...to identify her father's body.

69
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:16,624
An hour ago, Rudy Linnekar
had this town in his pocket.

70
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,916
Hmm. Now you can
strain him through a sieve.

71
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,457
I guess that's my father.

72
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,957
Now, Miss Linnekar,
can you identify the woman?

73
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:36,124
I'm not acquainted with
my father's girlfriends.

74
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,874
Okay, Miss Linnekar.

75
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,874
Well, here comes Hank at last.

76
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,791
Vargas, you've heard of Hank Quinlan,
our local police celebrity.

77
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:49,499
- I'd like to meet him.
- That's what you think.

78
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,124
Did they, uh,

79
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,249
toss it in, or was it, uh,

80
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,041
planted ahead of time?

81
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,124
Who?

82
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,874
Whoever did it, you jackass.

83
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:18,124
Hey, lady, look at the pretty baby.

84
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,707
<i>Mire el niño.</i>

85
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:37,874
My nephew says you call him Pancho. Why?

86
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,291
Why you call him Pancho?

87
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:45,291
Just for laughs, I guess. This note says
you have something for my husband.

88
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:46,749
Yeah?

89
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:51,041
Señor Vargas, eh? You know who I am?

90
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:55,416
- You want me to guess?
- My name is Grandi.

91
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,707
- Oh.
- You have heard that name before, hmm?

92
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,249
Aside from the case
my husband's been working on,

93
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,207
isn't "Grandi" what
that nightclub is called?

94
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:05,832
Yeah.

95
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:09,291
Yes. Grandi's Rancho Grande.

96
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:11,707
My gun. Kind of a joke.

97
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,499
Get it?

98
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,249
I can't say it's the funniest thing
I ever heard.

99
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:22,374
The name ain't Mexican.
I got a permit for this thing.

100
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,874
The Grandi family is living here
in Los Robles a long time.

101
00:09:26,374 --> 00:09:28,124
Some of us in Mexico,
some of us on this side.

102
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,416
- Must be convenient for business.
- Yeah?

103
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,499
- What business?
- Grandi business.

104
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,832
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

105
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,416
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

106
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:39,749
You know what's wrong with you,
Mr. Grandi?

107
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,332
You've been seeing
too many gangster movies.

108
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,499
- Mike may be spoiling some of your fun--
- Mike?

109
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,166
My husband. Yeah!

110
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:50,332
And if you're trying to scare me
into calling him off,

111
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:52,707
let me tell you something, Mr. Grandi.

112
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:55,582
I may be scared, but he won't be.

113
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,749
You figure it was a bomb then, Hank?

114
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,916
Well, Chief, Rudy Linnekar
could have been struck by lightning.

115
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:02,499
- Uh, where's the daughter?
- Marcia?

116
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,582
Got her right here waiting for you, Hank.

117
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:06,624
Let her go.

118
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,416
You don't even want to question
the daughter?

119
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:11,791
Let her go and put a tail on her.

120
00:10:12,374 --> 00:10:15,207
Let's see if there was some jane
that Rudy Linnekar--

121
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:16,707
Oh, just some, uh,
stripteaser from--

122
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:18,457
What do you know? The DA.

123
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:20,457
In a monkey suit.

124
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:22,541
- Well, it's--
- You too. You got one of them--

125
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:24,832
- Well, we were all at the banquet.
- A political rally.

126
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,666
- No! Tootsie's Steak House.
- G-men, T-men.

127
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:32,416
Quite a little tea party,
all for Rudy Linnekar's bonfire.

128
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:36,249
Yeah, I hear you even invited
some kind of a Mexi--

129
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:40,082
Oh, I don't think Mr. Vargas
claims any jurisdiction.

130
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,499
Oh, I should hope not.

131
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,166
Two people, Americans,
are blown to hash with dynamite

132
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:46,582
practically in my own police station.

133
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:49,666
I wonder, what makes you
so very sure it was dynamite?

134
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,291
My leg.

135
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:53,041
- Your what?
- His game leg.

136
00:10:53,624 --> 00:10:56,749
Sometimes he gets a kind of a twinge,
like folks do for a change of weather.

137
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,541
- "Intuition,” he calls it.
- Hmm.

138
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:03,374
Vargas has a theory that the murder itself
was committed outside of our jurisdiction.

139
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:05,874
Of course, we're all of us going to
cooperate with Mr. Vargas.

140
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,082
Don't worry, Captain.

141
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,207
I'm merely what the United Nations
would call "an observer."

142
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,791
Well, you don't talk like one,
I'll say that for you.

143
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,749
Uh, Mexican, I mean.

144
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,124
Captain, you won't have
any trouble with me.

145
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,541
You bet your sweet life I won't.

146
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:25,832
As a matter of fact, Mike must be
looking for me just about now,

147
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,082
- and that's bound to mean trouble.

148
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:31,499
- What's so funny about that?

149
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:35,791
Ah. He wants to know if your husband...
husband is jealous, senora.

150
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:37,916
You silly little pig.

151
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:42,624
- Who are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you,

152
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,916
you ridiculous, old-fashioned,

153
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:47,124
jug-eared, lopsided Little Caesar.

154
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,332
|I didn't get that, senora.
You'll have to talk slow.

155
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:54,332
I'm talking slow,
but in a minute, I'll start to yell.

156
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:57,207
I wouldn't do that, senora.

157
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:05,874
Just a little while ago,
this was a quiet, peaceful town here.

158
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,957
- And now this Vargas comes along and--
- Mr. Grandi.

159
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:11,707
Mr. Grandi. You said you had
something for my husband.

160
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:13,541
Don't you think it's time
you gave it to me?

161
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:16,832
I think it's time for him
to lay off my brother in Mexico City!

162
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,291
That's advice.

163
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:21,957
That's what I got for him.

164
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:30,666
- Then the conference is over?

165
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,666
I'm free to leave?

166
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,249
"Free"?

167
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,499
Nobody was holding you
or keeping you, Mrs. Vargas.

168
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,291
Nobody laid a hand on you.

169
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:44,749
You were just paying us a little visit.

170
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,416
Well...

171
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,541
Good-bye, all.

172
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:10,499
Quinlan, we just can't cross over
into Mexico like this.

173
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,791
- Thousands do every day.
- Tourists, but--

174
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:14,707
So, we're tourists.

175
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:17,416
Captain Quinlan wants to check on the girl

176
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:19,291
that was with Linnekar in the death car.

177
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:22,332
I know. She was one of the stripteasers.
I think I told you.

178
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:25,166
Yeah, Pete told me
before I left the ranch.

179
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:27,332
- That's right.
- And I told him

180
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:30,166
that I wanted to see all
the stripteasers in the joint.

181
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:32,666
This is Mexican territory. What can we do?

182
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:36,957
There's no law against visitors
asking questions, is there, Mr. Vargas?

183
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,541
Hey. Where'd he go?

184
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,457
Susie, where in the world were you?

185
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:45,166
- Oh, Mike, darling.
- What happened?

186
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:48,082
Just wait till I tell you.
The craziest thing.

187
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,624
- Who's the jane?
- His wife.

188
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,332
Well, what do you know?

189
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,666
She don't look Mexican either.

190
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,832
The key to this whole thing
is the dynamite.

191
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,957
The killer didn't just want Linnekar dead.

192
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,416
He wanted him destroyed, annihilated.

193
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:33,374
Over here, Vargas.
We're going in the back way.

194
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:38,374
<i>Señor Vargas.</i>

195
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:40,582
<i>Señor Vargas.</i>

196
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,166
Yes?

197
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:07,541
Anything wrong, Vargas?

198
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:10,957
No, I just couldn't catch him.

199
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:12,874
Oh.

200
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,541
- I hardly knew her.

201
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:20,249
Hmm. Adair, come on.

202
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,416
Yes, yes.
And I'm not finished with you yet.

203
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:25,624
- The show's over. I'm going home.
- I-- You-- Oh.

204
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,791
- Oh, no, no, ma'am.
- Mr. Adair, as far as

205
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:29,124
I can find out, none of these people

206
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,791
- even knew the murdered girl.
- I have no--

207
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,707
- I must talk to this young lady.
- Not Zita?

208
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:33,916
-Zita?
- Yeah.

209
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:37,332
I didn't know her. She only joined
the show a few days ago.

210
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,874
We're wasting
our time around here.

211
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,207
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Well, good night, my dear.

212
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,749
What happened
to Menzies and Vargas?

213
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:49,416
I don't know. They'll show up.

214
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:50,957
There may be some more questions.

215
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,124
Hmm.

216
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:54,707
Pianola.

217
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:57,041
Hank! W--we go this way, you know.

218
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,749
Tana still open for business?

219
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,499
I don't know what Quinlan thinks
she's got to do with it.

220
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,832
Tana? Oh, maybe she'll
cook chili for him,

221
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:48,082
or, uh, bring out the crystal ball.

222
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:06,999
We're closed.

223
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,457
- You been cookin' at this hour?
- Just cleanin' up.

224
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,624
Oh.

225
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,666
Have you forgotten your old friend, hmm?

226
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:29,166
I told you we were closed.

227
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:31,166
I'm Hank Quinlan.

228
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:35,249
I didn't recognize you.

229
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:38,291
You should lay off those candy bars.

230
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:42,707
Aw, it's either the candy or the hooch.

231
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:47,041
I must say, I wish it was
your chili I was getting fat on.

232
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,041
Anyway, you're sure looking good.

233
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:54,416
You're a mess, honey.

234
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:55,791
Yeah.

235
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:59,999
Ah, that pianola
sure brings back memories.

236
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:04,291
The customers go for it. So old it's new.

237
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,707
We got the television too.

238
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:15,291
We run movies. What can I offer you?

239
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:18,082
You haven't heard anything
about that bomb, have you?

240
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,499
That happened on your side of the border.

241
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:25,457
In a place like this, you hear things.

242
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:28,666
I heard the explosion.

243
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,666
Yeah.

244
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:36,374
Well, when this case is over,
I must come around some night

245
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,374
and sample some of your chili.

246
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:41,332
Better be careful. May be too hot for you.

247
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,957
- Oh, Hank.
- Yeah?

248
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,666
Looks like our friend Vargas

249
00:18:47,832 --> 00:18:49,332
- ran into some trouble.
- What happened?

250
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,291
In the alley behind the nightclub.

251
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,541
Yeah?

252
00:18:57,457 --> 00:18:58,916
- Well, what happened to Vargas?
- What happened?

253
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:00,291
- What was it, Al?
- Nothing.

254
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,041
- Oh, no?
- Al

255
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,291
Certainly nothing to do
with this bombing affair.

256
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:05,999
- Oh, yeah?
- Somebody threw acid at Vargas.

257
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,082
It doesn't matter. He missed.

258
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:10,374
- Who was it, Al?
- I don't know.

259
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,999
- He got away.
- Oh...

260
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,041
It's just one of the Grandi kids.

261
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:16,332
What makes you so sure
of that, Captain?

262
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:19,249
- Intuition.
- Intuition?

263
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:23,749
Well, Vargas and his Keystone Cops
seem to be giving the Grandi family

264
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:25,291
- quite a few headaches lately.
- Captain.

265
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,791
- Yes?
- Does your intuition also tell you

266
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:29,041
about my wife?

267
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,207
Wife?

268
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:32,166
She was accosted in the street
a little while ago

269
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:34,916
and led across to some dive
on your side of the border.

270
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,582
Hmm. The Vargas family
seems to be getting into

271
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:41,457
quite a lot of trouble tonight.

272
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,707
- Can you describe this man?
- Well, the first one seems to have been--

273
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,249
- Oh, the first one.
- ...young, good-looking--

274
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,749
Now, there were two men?

275
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:51,457
- Not exactly.
- Not exactly.

276
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:54,041
You say she was taken
to this dive by force?

277
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,166
- Not by force, no.
- Oh.

278
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,041
One of the Grandis was there waiting.

279
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:00,749
Short, fat, with a mustache.

280
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:01,999
- That's Susan's description.
- Uncle Joe.

281
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,666
I haven't run into him. I--what?

282
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:05,374
They call him Uncle Joe Grandi.

283
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,541
That's right.

284
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:08,791
- Go on.
- Well--

285
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:11,582
What do you mean, "Go on"?

286
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:14,041
I've told you what happened.
Aren't you going to do something about it?

287
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:16,041
To make it a charge,
you gotta have a complaint,

288
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:18,332
or isn't that police procedure in Mexico?

289
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:20,332
- Procedure?
- You say your wife was attacked.

290
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:22,666
- I did not say she was attacked.
- Did you say she was molested?

291
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:25,957
- Not physically molested, no.
- Was obscene language used?

292
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,124
<i>- I don't think so.
- Then how do you explain the fact that</i>

293
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,041
your--your wife allowed herself
to be picked up by this--

294
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:32,332
She was not picked up.

295
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,249
Now Hank, I think we're getting
off on the wrong tack here.

296
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,332
Then this good-looking young man
was a friend of hers?

297
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:37,541
Obviously not.

298
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:39,166
You wouldn't call that getting
picked up in the street?

299
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:40,332
Now, now, now.

300
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:42,207
We--we mustn't forget, must we,

301
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:44,416
that Mr. Vargas is not
on the witness stand.

302
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:46,124
- Uh--

303
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,582
- Hank's a born lawyer, you know.
- Lawyer.

304
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,999
I'm no lawyer.
All a lawyer cares about is the law.

305
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,832
Captain, you are a policeman, aren't you?

306
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:55,499
Mm. Aren't you?

307
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,541
You don't seem to be very fond of the job.

308
00:20:57,707 --> 00:20:59,707
There are plenty of soldiers
who don't like war.

309
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:02,499
- Hmm.
- It's a dirty job, enforcing the law,

310
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,541
but it's what we're supposed
to be doing, isn't it?

311
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:05,707
I don't know about you,

312
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:08,582
but when a murderer's loose,
I'm supposed to catch him.

313
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:12,999
Well, Pete,

314
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,332
let's get back to civilization.

315
00:21:26,082 --> 00:21:28,582
Let's go, Hank. It's almost dawn.
You gotta get some rest.

316
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,582
No chance of that, partner.

317
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,916
We got a big day ahead of us.

318
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:23,041
See any better this way?

319
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:32,874
You can turn it off now, buster.
You're wasting your batteries.

320
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,916
- Susie.

321
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,457
What are you doing here in the dark?

322
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:49,249
There isn't any shade on the window.

323
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,166
Well, can we turn the light on now?

324
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,374
- No, we can't.
- Why not?

325
00:22:56,582 --> 00:22:59,082
Because there isn't any bulb anymore.

326
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,416
Susie.

327
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:09,874
Risto. Risto!

328
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,832
Uncle Joe is plenty mad.
He wants to talk to you.

329
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:16,374
Risto. Risto, come back here!

330
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,332
Sal, grab him. Stop him!

331
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:25,916
Grab him, Sal!

332
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,041
Who told you to throw acid at Vargas?

333
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:31,207
Stop him!

334
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,832
Who told you to throw acid at Vargas, hmm?

335
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,041
Who's the boss of this family, hmm?

336
00:23:42,207 --> 00:23:43,749
- Who is the boss?
- My old man.

337
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:47,166
Yeah, Vic, sure. But he's in the pen.

338
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:49,624
Until he gets out,
who's running this outfit?

339
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,916
- Oh, stop it, will ya?
- Who is in charge?

340
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:54,082
- All right, you.

341
00:23:54,874 --> 00:23:57,124
Oh, what a setup to work with.

342
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,624
One brother in jail, two others dead,

343
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:03,291
and nobody left to carry on the business
but a bunch of nephews.

344
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:04,999
- Listen, Unc--
- Don't do that!

345
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,457
- You lost your rug, Uncle Joe.
- Half of you too wet behind the ears.

346
00:24:07,624 --> 00:24:08,624
Your rug! You lost your rug.

347
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:11,499
This isn't the real Mexico. You know that.

348
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:15,207
All border towns bring out
the worst in a country.

349
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:19,416
I can just imagine your mother's face
if she could see our honeymoon hotel.

350
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:20,832
- <i>Señor Vargas.
- Un momento.</i>

351
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:23,499
Does this mean you're taking
that early plane back to Mexico City?

352
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,916
<i>- Teléfono.
- Teléfono.</i>

353
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:28,082
Because it doesn't leave
for another two hours, you know.

354
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:34,041
All I can say is, if you are taking
that plane, I'm very glad.

355
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,707
I am very glad you're very glad.

356
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,499
<i>Sí.</i>

357
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:45,582
Who told you to start
this funny stuff with the acid?

358
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:48,374
Who told you?

359
00:24:48,582 --> 00:24:49,874
I just wanted to give that wife of his

360
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,624
something to think about
on their honeymoon.

361
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:53,666
She's gonna get plenty. Don't you worry.

362
00:24:53,832 --> 00:24:54,957
Here. You lost your rug.

363
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:57,041
- What?
- You lost your rug.

364
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:59,457
- Oh.
- My old man is in no shape for the pen.

365
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,999
- If they give him 10, he dies.
- Yeah?

366
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:05,166
And if Vargas gets hurt, what happens?

367
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:08,582
My brother, Vic,
is just as good as convicted.

368
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,249
- You leave Vargas to me.
- Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe.

369
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:12,791
What?

370
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,791
Sal.

371
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:25,666
This, take it to her.

372
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:38,166
I don't want any more postcards.

373
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,916
<i>¿Qué es eso?</i>

374
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,416
I don't speak any Spanish.
What is it? What do you want?

375
00:25:45,582 --> 00:25:47,666
I don't know. I was told
to put this in your hands.

376
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,082
- Susie.
- Mike, look at the--

377
00:26:04,249 --> 00:26:05,582
That was the police.

378
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:08,249
Quinlan has a lead.
I'm sorry, I have to meet him.

379
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,291
Now, you must tell me what you want to do.

380
00:26:10,457 --> 00:26:12,082
If you are going to Mexico City, I--

381
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:14,624
I have time to take you to the airport.

382
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:18,124
Perhaps that would be best,
just for a few days.

383
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,957
<i>- I don't think so.
- But just a minute ago--</i>

384
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:22,832
A minute ago, I said a lot of things.

385
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,374
But now I think the best thing
is to stick close to my husband.

386
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:26,957
Okay?

387
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:30,624
Susie--

388
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:37,916
- So, Mike, I'm coming with you.
- Coming with--

389
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,207
But I have to see Quinlan
at the American police station.

390
00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:44,041
- I'll wait at the motel.
- What motel?

391
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:46,707
Well, there must be one somewhere
on the American side of the border.

392
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:48,957
The American side of the border.

393
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:52,082
Oh, well, I'll be safe there.
You won't have to worry about me.

394
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,207
Did I say the wrong thing again?

395
00:26:56,374 --> 00:27:00,207
No, I suppose it would be nice
for a man in my place

396
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:03,582
to be able to think he could look after
his own wife in his own country.

397
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:07,416
Oh, Mike, if I go to the American motel,
it's just for comfort.

398
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:10,082
- Sure, sure.
- Not for safety.

399
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,332
Whatever you say, mi vida.

400
00:27:17,624 --> 00:27:20,166
...wealthy contractor,
Rudolph Linnekar,

401
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,541
has definitely been identified

402
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,624
with a blonde nightclub dancer

403
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:28,332
killed in the explosion a few yards
this side of the Mexican border.

404
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,957
We're gonna get him where it really hurts.

405
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:35,416
And without laying a hand on him.

406
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:45,082
He's got a reputation.
He's got a young bride.

407
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:49,791
He's gonna leave this town wishing he
and that wife of his had never been born.

408
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,582
Now, don't you see, darling,

409
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:03,874
if the bomb was planted in Mexico,

410
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,249
and the accused is Mexican,

411
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:09,749
what a scandal this could turn into
internationally?

412
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:12,582
It might be kind of rough
on the tourist trade.

413
00:28:13,332 --> 00:28:16,666
Susie, one of the longest
borders on Earth

414
00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:19,582
is right here between
your country and mine.

415
00:28:20,124 --> 00:28:25,916
An open border. 1,400 miles without
a single machine gun in place.

416
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,666
I suppose that all sounds
very corny to you.

417
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:35,041
I could love being corny
if my husband will only cooperate.

418
00:28:35,874 --> 00:28:37,624
Hey, Susie.

419
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,916
Well...

420
00:29:06,874 --> 00:29:08,874
- Vargas?
- Hello there, Schwartz.

421
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,916
Quinlan seems to be onto something new.
Coming with us?

422
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,416
I have first to drop my wife at the motel.

423
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:14,749
Captain Quinlan wants you to go with him.

424
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:16,374
I'll be glad to drop your wife
at the motel.

425
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:18,124
- Oh, really, I--
- No trouble at all, ma'am.

426
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,791
- Aren't you going to drive me?
- I'll phone you, darling.

427
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:22,416
- What's the name of that motel?
- The Mirador.

428
00:29:22,582 --> 00:29:24,166
- The Mirador.
- Quinlan"s in kind of a hurry, Vargas.

429
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:26,207
- Don't bother to phone.
- You try to get some sleep, Susie.

430
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:28,541
That Mirador is mighty hard to find,

431
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:31,416
with the new highway
branching off the way it does.

432
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:32,749
Hey!

433
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:35,249
- That's all right. I can find the way.
- Oh, gee, I for--

434
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:38,624
His cane. I forgot to give him his cane.

435
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,332
He really needs it
with that game leg of his.

436
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,832
- They ever tell you how he got it, huh?
- What, the cane?

437
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,749
- No, his bad leg.
- Who are you talking about?

438
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,249
Captain Quinlan.

439
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:52,666
He got it in a gunfight,
Mrs. Vargas, that's how.

440
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,416
He was wounded stopping a bullet
that was meant for me.

441
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:01,041
I reckon the bravest thing Hank ever did
was to give up drink.

442
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:03,666
He used to be a terrible lush, you know.

443
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:08,624
But look at him now. No sleep,
still at it. Hey, he never gives up.

444
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:42,249
- What's wrong?
- What are you following us for?

445
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,541
Get outta the car.

446
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:45,666
What, a man can't take
a ride in his own car?

447
00:30:45,832 --> 00:30:47,999
- What's the big idea?
- You'll find out. Come on.

448
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,082
Don't push me.
Keep your hands off me!

449
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:52,082
Wake up, Mrs. Vargas. We're here.

450
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:53,582
This is it.

451
00:30:54,707 --> 00:30:56,124
This can't be it.

452
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:58,707
It's all the motel we got
this side of town, ma'am.

453
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:01,249
The others are all on the new highway,
and most of them

454
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:02,999
are closed up till the season starts.

455
00:31:03,874 --> 00:31:06,957
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yeah.

456
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:10,082
Now, listen, Sergeant.
How long are you gonna hold me here?

457
00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:11,416
- I didn't do nothing--
- Shut up.

458
00:31:11,582 --> 00:31:12,999
Mrs. Vargas, can you identify this man?

459
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,541
Of course I can identify him.
That's Grandi.

460
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,582
- I know.
- I'm a member of the family, sure,

461
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:20,332
- but nobody has laid a hand on her.
- Shut up.

462
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:21,957
- Eh, eh.
- Get in that car.

463
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:25,457
- What about my car?
- You can leave it here.

464
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:26,749
What, here?

465
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,749
- In the middle of nowhere?
- You're coming with me.

466
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,957
- On what charge?
-I don't know yet.

467
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,791
That's for Captain Quinlan to decide.

468
00:31:34,082 --> 00:31:35,957
Well, what was Grandi doing way out here?

469
00:31:36,124 --> 00:31:37,999
- I was just driving.
- He was following us in his car.

470
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,416
Just driving along.

471
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,124
Oh, well, where are my bags?

472
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:44,207
We've already put them
by your cabin, Mrs. Vargas.

473
00:31:44,374 --> 00:31:46,624
- There it is.
- The last one. Number seven.

474
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:49,666
If you should want to change,
just phone the man at the desk.

475
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:53,457
Off-season like this, I reckon
you're about the only one staying here.

476
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,707
Uh-- Uh--

477
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:51,707
I turned the music on up
for you up at the office.

478
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,416
Uh, I--

479
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:02,666
- I turned the music on up for you up at--

480
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,124
- I thought you'd like.
- Not just now.

481
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,291
It's past seven,
and I haven't been to bed yet.

482
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:09,499
Bed?

483
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:14,124
Well, you can get into it now.
I brought the sheets.

484
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:18,041
They think I'm gonna help make it,
they got another thing coming.

485
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:21,207
I'm--I'm not gonna be
a party to... nothin'.

486
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,666
- I'm the night-- Uh--

487
00:33:23,832 --> 00:33:26,166
It's--it's day already.

488
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:29,832
- I'm the night man.
- Can't the day man help me

489
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:31,082
make the bed?

490
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:33,957
There ain't no day man.

491
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:37,666
He's supposed to be here
at six o'clock this morning,

492
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:40,707
and now they--they phone me
and they tell me he ain't comin' at all.

493
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:43,999
They--they're sendin' a new man. New man.

494
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:46,374
Well, if they think I'm gonna stay here
and wait for him,

495
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:47,624
they--they got another thing--

496
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,707
Well, won't you help me make the bed?

497
00:33:51,707 --> 00:33:52,874
Bed?

498
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,666
Hey, wait a minute.

499
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:59,166
That--that friend of yours.

500
00:33:59,332 --> 00:34:00,916
Mr. Grandi. He--he--

501
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:02,874
He ain't gonna leave you here for long.

502
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,749
He is not my friend.

503
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:09,791
He--he brought you here
in that--that car, didn't he?

504
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:13,124
No, he didn't.
As a matter of fact, he's under arrest.

505
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:16,791
Under arrest? Mr. Grandi?

506
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:19,332
- Yes, he is.

507
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:30,082
Hold that second charge!

508
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,457
Stop that car!

509
00:34:32,957 --> 00:34:34,416
Hold that car! Stop!

510
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:35,957
Stop! Hold it!

511
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:44,791
Hey, uh, there was a complaint

512
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,832
about some stolen dynamite out here.

513
00:34:47,124 --> 00:34:48,666
You fired anybody lately?

514
00:34:49,082 --> 00:34:50,916
I figured you'd be asking about that.

515
00:34:51,082 --> 00:34:52,707
Yeah? Boy named Sanchez?

516
00:34:52,874 --> 00:34:53,999
Sure.

517
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:56,791
He's been playin' around
with the boss's daughter.

518
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:59,582
Say, Captain, I just recognized somebody
over there at the blaster.

519
00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:00,874
With the big ears?

520
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:02,999
Our office prosecuted that guy
for voluntary manslaughter.

521
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,832
Get him over here. That's Eddie Farnum.

522
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:06,499
- You!
- Got five to 10.

523
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:10,082
You have to get outta here.
We're gonna blast again.

524
00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:11,416
How long you been out?

525
00:35:12,332 --> 00:35:13,832
- Three months.
- Quick parole.

526
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:16,707
- Who got you this job?
- My lawyer, Howard Frantz.

527
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:18,582
- <i>Come in, Car 10.</i>
- Grandi's lawyer.

528
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:22,124
<i>Come in, Car 10.
Suspect now in custody at five-four--</i>

529
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:24,166
- Well, this is it.
- Suspect?

530
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,249
- Hmm.
- That the one you been talking about?

531
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,874
- This Sanchez?
- Far as I can make out,

532
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,416
they've located him, right, Captain?

533
00:35:29,582 --> 00:35:31,499
Yeah, in Marcia Linnekar's
apartment. Come on.

534
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,416
Stand still. We're gonna blast.

535
00:35:36,749 --> 00:35:40,082
What's wrong, Farnum?
You short of dynamite?

536
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:00,499
Captain, have you anything definite
on this boy Sanchez?

537
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,832
Not yet. I'm just...
goin' on my intuition.

538
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,207
Hey, I think this car belongs
to Howard Frantz.

539
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:07,874
- Yeah?
- You remember him.

540
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,041
He was that slick lawyer
that got Farnum a parole.

541
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,916
Yeah, he was
Rudy Linnekar's attorney too.

542
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:15,124
Isn't that Quinlan?

543
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:16,499
Quinlan?

544
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,249
Well, it figured we'd have
Hank Quinlan to deal with.

545
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:20,666
You finished packing?

546
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:21,957
I've heard about that guy.

547
00:36:22,124 --> 00:36:23,416
Say nothing, my dear.
Leave everything to me.

548
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,082
Let's get your bag.

549
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:46,999
Remember, I'll do all the talking.

550
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:48,791
How do we begin?

551
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,541
Do we play around first
with a few nasty questions,

552
00:36:51,707 --> 00:36:53,416
or does he get out
the rubber hose right away?

553
00:36:53,582 --> 00:36:56,124
- Take it easy.

554
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,207
- Vargas.

555
00:36:59,374 --> 00:37:00,707
Yes, Captain.

556
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:04,666
Got my orders, Vargas.

557
00:37:04,832 --> 00:37:07,916
I'm supposed to extend you every courtesy.

558
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:11,416
That don't mean you...
you do the interrogatin'.

559
00:37:11,582 --> 00:37:14,207
I know, Captain.
That's what I told Sanchez.

560
00:37:14,374 --> 00:37:16,082
Uh, you're Ed Hansen?

561
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,332
- That's right, Captain Quinlan.
- Uh, run out and get me some coffee, Ed.

562
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:21,916
How about you, Miss Linnekar?
Uh, Marcia, isn't it?

563
00:37:22,082 --> 00:37:24,332
- Uh, want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

564
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:26,874
Yeah, well, I really need it.

565
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,541
I'm an old man, Marcia.

566
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,457
I go a whole night without sleep, feel it.

567
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,624
Of course, it was a lot worse for you.

568
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,957
Terrible thing, what happened to your dad.

569
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,874
You been living here for some time,
Marcia? How long?

570
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:43,791
- Four months.
- Marcia!

571
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:45,874
Uh, you had a quarrel with your dad?

572
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,124
- Perhaps I should introduce myself.
- Moved out on your own?

573
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:49,874
- I'm Miss Linnekar's attorney.
- I know who you are.

574
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,541
- Shall I introduce myself?
- Yes, Mr. Frantz.

575
00:37:51,707 --> 00:37:53,916
I'm Manolo Sanchez,
and I haven't got any attorney!

576
00:37:54,082 --> 00:37:56,541
Uh, you two been sharing this apartment?

577
00:37:56,707 --> 00:38:00,457
I must explain. On my advice,
my client is moving elsewhere.

578
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:02,541
That means that she has been
living with this man.

579
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:05,207
She will hold herself available
for your later questionings.

580
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,874
- I will be present, of course.
- Of course.

581
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,332
Uh, Marcia, where was
your friend Sanchez last night?

582
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:14,749
Later, Captain. Later, after she's rested.

583
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:16,957
- Come, my dear.
- jQuerida!

584
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:20,416
Uh, Casey, would you take a look
in the desk there?

585
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:22,374
Might be some letters or something.

586
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:24,624
That is, unless you've
already looked the place over.

587
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:27,041
We know better than that, Captain.
We were waiting for you.

588
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:28,666
- Yeah.

589
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,791
- I, uh--

590
00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:37,374
- I don't speak Mexican.

591
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:41,999
- Let's, uh...
<i>- Un momento, muchacho.</i>

592
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,707
Keep it in English, Vargas.

593
00:38:44,624 --> 00:38:45,999
It's all right with me.

594
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,249
I'm sure he's just as unpleasant
in any language.

595
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,499
"Unpleasant"? "Strange"?

596
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:53,291
I've been told I have
a very winning personality.

597
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,916
The very best shoe clerk
the store ever had.

598
00:38:56,082 --> 00:38:59,207
Uh, you weren't working as a shoe clerk
on that construction crew.

599
00:38:59,374 --> 00:39:02,791
- Stick around, Vargas.
- I intend to.

600
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:05,416
Uh, in English.
I don't like repeating myself.

601
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:07,666
I merely asked him
if I could use the telephone.

602
00:39:07,832 --> 00:39:09,957
- Asked?

603
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:12,666
Translation:

604
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:15,832
The telephone is in the bedroom, senor.

605
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:17,874
That's all he said.

606
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:23,624
Also, he told me he thinks
he's in for some sort of third degree.

607
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:26,249
I assured him he had
nothing to worry about.

608
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,541
Casey, go in with Vargas.

609
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:32,291
Maybe he don't know how to use
an American telephone.

610
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:35,166
I think I run onto something here,
Captain. Some love letters.

611
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,207
Oh, you can read them in the bedroom.

612
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:39,749
I don't want to leave
that Vargas guy alone.

613
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:42,249
- Okay.
- Save the good stuff for me.

614
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:44,832
- Now, in English.
- What do you want to know?

615
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:46,332
Everything, boy. The works.

616
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:47,582
Let's start with the shoe store.

617
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:49,707
- Want me to call the motel, Vargas?
- Later.

618
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:51,749
That's how you met Linnekar's
daughter, isn't it? In the shoe store.

619
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,832
Yes, selling her shoes.
And I've been at her feet ever since.

620
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:56,749
Then the construction job.

621
00:39:56,916 --> 00:40:00,291
You stayed just long enough on that one
to get your hands on some dynamite.

622
00:40:00,457 --> 00:40:02,791
What are you scared of, boy?
I'd only slap you again

623
00:40:02,957 --> 00:40:04,457
if you got hysterical again.

624
00:40:04,624 --> 00:40:06,416
Wouldn't be anything brutal.

625
00:40:06,582 --> 00:40:09,457
Why, even back in the old days,
we never tried to hurt people in the face.

626
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:10,749
Marks 'em up.

627
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:13,666
- We gave it to 'em like this!

628
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:15,707
Boy's getting a rough deal.

629
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:18,207
He could even be innocent, you know.

630
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,374
- Intuition?
- Why not?

631
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,999
Quinlan doesn't have
a monopoly on hunches.

632
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:26,041
Well, who do you like for the killer?

633
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,999
Too early to tell. That ex-convict.

634
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:32,041
You mean out on that highway job. Farnum.

635
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:33,749
- Maybe.
- Wait a minute.

636
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:35,374
Some dynamite was stolen.

637
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:38,332
Yeah. And that construction crew's
working for Linnekar.

638
00:40:38,499 --> 00:40:39,749
Amigo, I think you're onto something.

639
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:43,707
Yeah, it's quite an apartment,
for a shoe clerk.

640
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:46,832
- Who pays for it? Marcia?
- What if she does?

641
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:48,916
How long has this been going on, huh?

642
00:40:49,082 --> 00:40:51,666
Ever since her father had me fired
from the last job, if you want to know.

643
00:40:51,832 --> 00:40:55,457
Naturally, he objected to having a Mexican
shoe clerk for a son-in-law.

644
00:40:55,624 --> 00:40:56,666
- So, naturally--
- Naturally--

645
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,166
...you had to put him out of the way.

646
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,124
Naturally!

647
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,166
Just because he speaks a little guilty,

648
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:04,374
that don't make him innocent, you know.

649
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:07,416
You can show motive, yes.
But won't you need a bit more than that?

650
00:41:07,582 --> 00:41:09,041
Well, we'll get it.

651
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:11,249
Oh, there's my coffee.

652
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:15,249
Didn't you bring me
any doughnuts or sweet rolls?

653
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:17,416
You'll have to put him
on the scene of the crime.

654
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:19,416
- We will.
- You've got to have some evidence.

655
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:21,791
We'll get it. What-- Well?

656
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:23,582
Well, you didn't ask me
to get any doughnuts, Captain.

657
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:24,999
Where you going?

658
00:41:26,124 --> 00:41:28,041
This is not my case, Captain.

659
00:41:28,207 --> 00:41:30,374
What finally convinced you of that?

660
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:33,916
This is not my country, that's all.
I'm not convinced.

661
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:36,291
Well, ain't that a shame? Hmm.

662
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:39,791
- There another phone near here?
- Right across the street.

663
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:57,207
Excuse me. Madame, could I use
your telephone, please?

664
00:41:57,374 --> 00:41:59,082
Right in front of you.

665
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,582
Do you have a phone book?

666
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:03,957
I'm blind, mister.
You'll have to ask for Information.

667
00:42:04,124 --> 00:42:05,624
Oh, I'm sorry.

668
00:42:12,082 --> 00:42:15,957
Hello, I'd like the telephone number
of the Mirador Motel.

669
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:18,499
- What is this place you're taking me to?
- Get going.

670
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:20,624
- Now, listen, this is ridiculous.
- Now, go on.

671
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,624
- Who's this?
- Who are you? Don't push.

672
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,832
- Where's Captain Quinlan?
- He's in there making a search.

673
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:28,207
- What am I doing in here?
- Oh, Hank.

674
00:42:28,374 --> 00:42:30,416
What's the idea,
barging in on me like this?

675
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:32,166
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- Who you got in here?

676
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:33,332
I forgot to give you your cane.

677
00:42:33,499 --> 00:42:35,749
- Sit down.
- Queer thing, Hank.

678
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:37,749
- I know him.
- When I was taking Mrs. Vargas

679
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:39,874
to the motel,
I picked this guy on the way.

680
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,082
Yeah, I know him.

681
00:42:41,249 --> 00:42:43,707
It's Uncle Joe Grandi.
Why'd you bring him in here?

682
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:47,166
For some crazy reason,
he was following me in his car.

683
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:49,082
- He was tailing you?
- Yeah.

684
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:51,499
- Huh.

685
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:55,791
Why would I be following a cop?
He's an idiot.

686
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:58,582
Maybe because you thought
he was a Mexican cop,

687
00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:00,374
because you thought he was Vargas.

688
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:02,874
- He was driving Vargas's car.
- Oh.

689
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,707
- Right?
- So you're right.

690
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,124
So I thought I was following Vargas.
So what?

691
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:10,207
- Sit down.
- It's a free country.

692
00:43:10,374 --> 00:43:12,957
- Shut up.

693
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,666
Is this the Mirador Motel?
I'm trying to--

694
00:43:23,832 --> 00:43:26,082
Yes, it's the Mirador Motel, and it's me.

695
00:43:26,957 --> 00:43:30,457
Oh. Darling, the news is bad.

696
00:43:30,624 --> 00:43:33,541
Quinlan is about to arrest
that boy, Sanchez.

697
00:43:33,707 --> 00:43:35,874
Oh, Mike, is that why you called?

698
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,957
To tell me somebody's been arrested?

699
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:41,166
No, that's not really why I called.

700
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:42,666
It--

701
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,957
It's to tell you how sorry
I am about all this.

702
00:43:47,707 --> 00:43:49,666
How very, very much I love you.

703
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:53,082
Susie?

704
00:43:53,249 --> 00:43:55,999
I'm still here, my own darling Miguel.

705
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,957
Oh. I thought maybe you'd fallen asleep.

706
00:43:59,499 --> 00:44:02,499
I was just listening
to you breathe.

707
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:04,291
It's a lovely sound.

708
00:44:05,707 --> 00:44:07,249
But I am sleepy.

709
00:44:08,457 --> 00:44:09,957
Oh.

710
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:12,291
Uh, of course you are.

711
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:15,666
Well, then, I'll be calling you back
later. Good-bye for now.

712
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:17,957
Mike?

713
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:25,416
Hello?

714
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:26,707
Yes?

715
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,957
Oh, I just wanted to tell you
I'm awfully tired.

716
00:44:30,374 --> 00:44:33,249
Oh, excuse me.
This is Mrs. Vargas talking.

717
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:36,249
I know. It couldn't be anybody else.

718
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:37,791
- Oh?
- You're the only guest

719
00:44:37,957 --> 00:44:40,749
we got here just now, in the whole place.

720
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,582
Oh. Well, as I started to tell you,

721
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:45,707
there's no sign to put up
outside the door,

722
00:44:45,874 --> 00:44:48,999
and I just wanted to make sure
I wouldn't be disturbed.

723
00:44:50,124 --> 00:44:52,457
Oh, that is if you're
the one who's in charge.

724
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:54,582
Don't you worry, Mrs. Vargas.

725
00:44:54,957 --> 00:44:56,707
I'm the one who's in charge here.

726
00:44:57,249 --> 00:44:58,999
Nobody's going to get through to you...

727
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:00,916
unless I say so.

728
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:03,916
Oh, Vargas. Sergeant Menzies
wanted me to give you this.

729
00:45:04,457 --> 00:45:05,957
- Your car keys.
- Thanks.

730
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:14,791
Well. I was beginning to think
we'd lost you for good, amigo.

731
00:45:14,957 --> 00:45:16,166
I had a phone call to make.

732
00:45:16,332 --> 00:45:18,541
- English.

733
00:45:18,707 --> 00:45:19,874
English.

734
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,999
They've got me measured for the fall guy.

735
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:24,457
- Now, just a minute.
- Sure, I'm the fortune hunter

736
00:45:24,624 --> 00:45:26,207
who hypnotized Marcia.

737
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:28,624
Who made her Kill her father
for his money.

738
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,791
Boy, if I had that kind of power,

739
00:45:30,957 --> 00:45:32,832
I wouldn't be where I am today,
believe me.

740
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:34,457
You mean you don't care about the money?

741
00:45:35,707 --> 00:45:37,291
Why should I lie? If it hadn't
been for the money,

742
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:38,582
I wouldn't have given her a tumble.

743
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:39,916
- No?
- But I told her that

744
00:45:40,082 --> 00:45:41,374
right at the beginning.
But still, she wanted--

745
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:43,624
Why bother? You wouldn't believe it.

746
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:44,916
Try me.

747
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:47,499
I'm a good listener.

748
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:50,582
Well, instead of the man chasing the girl,

749
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,249
suppose she was the one.

750
00:45:52,707 --> 00:45:55,666
Suppose she asked him to marry her.
What should he do?

751
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:56,999
Draw himself up and say, "No, my dear,

752
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,457
you and I could never be happy together
because of your money"?

753
00:45:59,749 --> 00:46:02,541
- What would you do, Vargas?
- The question is, what did you do?

754
00:46:02,707 --> 00:46:04,749
Yeah, what did you do, boy?

755
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,749
Well, you know what I did,
Captain Quinlan.

756
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:09,124
- I know. I was asking you.
- Marcia and I made a bomb.

757
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:11,791
- That's right, you made a bomb.
- And we blew up her father, of course!

758
00:46:11,957 --> 00:46:13,749
And you're willing
to admit it.

759
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:15,707
- Don't you see you don't help yourself--
- He confessed.

760
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:17,457
...by treating this as a joke?

761
00:46:17,624 --> 00:46:19,416
Uh, eh, you finished?

762
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:21,791
Anything more you wanna say, Vargas?

763
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:23,166
- No, Captain.
- Oh, good.

764
00:46:23,332 --> 00:46:24,791
- Well, Pete, since you're here--
- Yes, Hank?

765
00:46:24,957 --> 00:46:26,249
I wish you'd search the place.

766
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,999
I'm, uh, too tired to go on with it.

767
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,249
S-Sanchez's desk has been looked into.

768
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:33,207
- Take the bedroom and, uh--
- Okay, Hank.

769
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,707
...and the bathroom.

770
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,791
I haven't been very thorough.

771
00:46:37,957 --> 00:46:40,416
Now, listen.
How long do I have to sit here?

772
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:42,957
I wasn't breaking no laws. I was just--

773
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:46,957
- I don't even know these people.
- You know Vargas, don't you?

774
00:46:47,124 --> 00:46:49,207
- Who's this?
- Uncle Joe Grandi.

775
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:50,457
- Another Grandi.
- Uncle Joe?

776
00:46:50,624 --> 00:46:53,041
Yeah, you nabbed his brother
on a narcotics rap.

777
00:46:53,207 --> 00:46:55,416
- I don't know this Grandi.
- Yeah?

778
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:57,457
- I got nothing to do with you.
- Shut up.

779
00:46:58,166 --> 00:46:59,791
I'm an American citizen.

780
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:03,291
Now, listen. Vic was arrested
in Mexico City, Captain.

781
00:47:03,457 --> 00:47:05,874
Vargas is gonna testify
at his trial Thursday.

782
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:08,166
It's got absolutely nothing to do with--

783
00:47:08,332 --> 00:47:11,207
- You try any rough stuff, Uncle Joe--
-I ain't no sucker.

784
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:14,082
He's a big shot in
the Mexican government. Listen.

785
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,874
Anybody lays a hand on Mr. Vargas
between now and Thursday,

786
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:21,166
and my brother, Vic, is just
as good as con-convicted.

787
00:47:21,332 --> 00:47:22,749
- Hank?
- Yeah?

788
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:24,582
- What is it, Pete?
- I found it.

789
00:47:24,749 --> 00:47:27,541
- Found what, uh, partner?
- Come here and look.

790
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:30,332
I don't even know this Sanchez.

791
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:32,832
All right, boy.
Boy, you come in here.

792
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:36,749
Now, in English, just how much dynamite
was it you stole?

793
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:39,249
What good would it be to tell
you that I've never seen any dynamite?

794
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:40,541
Poor Rudy Linnekar.

795
00:47:40,707 --> 00:47:42,457
He did all he could to keep you
away from his daughter,

796
00:47:42,624 --> 00:47:44,416
but she stands to inherit a million bucks,

797
00:47:44,582 --> 00:47:46,499
so naturally, you just moved in here--

798
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:47,791
Marcia and I
were married, secretly.

799
00:47:47,957 --> 00:47:49,124
- Yeah?
- A million bucks.

800
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,374
Ain't no secret about that.

801
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:51,832
And you got scared
he'd change his will.

802
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,582
Why don't you let up for a minute?

803
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:54,916
So you got yourself this highway job--

804
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:56,374
You broke into
the explosives bin and stole--

805
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,999
That's a lie!

806
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,166
You stole 10 sticks of dynamite!

807
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:00,457
No! No!

808
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:03,291
- Well, Hank has done it again.

809
00:48:03,457 --> 00:48:05,416
- He's nailed his man.
- Thanks to you, partner.

810
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,541
Me? Ah!

811
00:48:07,707 --> 00:48:09,541
If that dynamite had been
a snake there in the bathroom,

812
00:48:09,707 --> 00:48:11,332
it would have bit me!

813
00:48:11,499 --> 00:48:13,791
I promised Chief Gould that
I'd keep you informed, Vargas.

814
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,249
So I'm doing it. This is it.
We've broken the case.

815
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:19,541
Rudy Linnekar was blown up
with eight sticks of dynamite,

816
00:48:19,707 --> 00:48:21,332
and, uh, Sanchez stole 10.

817
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,957
That leaves two, and we found 'em both.

818
00:48:24,124 --> 00:48:26,666
You heard that, boy.
We found the dynamite.

819
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:30,749
- That's impossible.
- Well, we found two sticks.

820
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:31,916
Black Fox, the identical brand.

821
00:48:32,082 --> 00:48:33,166
The right number, right brand.

822
00:48:33,332 --> 00:48:35,207
- Where did you find this?
- Right here in your love nest.

823
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:37,082
- Where?
- Where you had it stashed, of course.

824
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:38,249
What are you trying to do?

825
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,124
We're trying to strap you
to the electric chair.

826
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:43,166
We don't like it when innocent people
are blown to jelly in our town!

827
00:48:43,332 --> 00:48:46,666
Yes, an old lady on Main Street last night
picked up a shoe.

828
00:48:46,999 --> 00:48:48,916
The shoe had a foot in it.

829
00:48:49,082 --> 00:48:50,499
We're gonna make you pay for that mess.

830
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:51,707
They're trying to railroad me.

831
00:48:51,874 --> 00:48:53,207
- Yeah.
- I don't know why.

832
00:48:53,374 --> 00:48:55,166
I never stole any dynamite.

833
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,291
- You'll have to stop him yourself.

834
00:48:58,457 --> 00:49:01,166
From now on, he can talk Hindu,
for all the good it'll do him.

835
00:49:02,832 --> 00:49:04,832
He swears on his mother's grave

836
00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:07,832
that there has never been any dynamite
in this apartment.

837
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:09,374
Sure, sure.

838
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:12,666
- Take him in. Book him.
- Let's go.

839
00:49:14,332 --> 00:49:16,666
You say you found this dynamite
in the bathroom.

840
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:18,207
Pete found it.
Show him the dynamite, Pete.

841
00:49:18,374 --> 00:49:21,332
- Right here.
- Can't you do something to help me?

842
00:49:24,249 --> 00:49:25,749
Oh, what are you scared of,
partner?

843
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:30,332
That stuff isn't nearly as easy to blow up
as people seem to think.

844
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:32,207
It doesn't go off quite that easy.

845
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:34,291
You found the dynamite in this box?

846
00:49:34,457 --> 00:49:35,541
Dynamite?

847
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:40,166
Yeah. Pete found it. I... told you that.

848
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:41,832
- Captain--
- Yeah?

849
00:49:43,207 --> 00:49:46,082
I looked in that box just now.

850
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:48,332
There wasn't anything there.

851
00:49:51,332 --> 00:49:52,916
I know how you feel.

852
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,041
- Do you?
- Sure, I do.

853
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:57,999
- You people are touchy.

854
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:00,874
- It's only human you'd want to

855
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,124
come to the defense
of your fellow countrymen.

856
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:11,582
Vargas.

857
00:50:11,749 --> 00:50:13,791
- Vargas, don't worry.
- Why should I worry?

858
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:16,207
Ah, you go right ahead
and say anything you want to.

859
00:50:16,374 --> 00:50:18,624
Folks'll bear your natural prejudice
in mind.

860
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:21,249
I saw that shoe box
10 minutes ago, Captain.

861
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,332
Yeah, well, maybe you didn't notice.

862
00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:25,457
I knocked it over in the bathroom floor.

863
00:50:25,624 --> 00:50:27,999
I couldn't very well have failed to notice
two sticks of dynamite.

864
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,041
- Tell any story you want.
- The shoe box was empty.

865
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:31,999
Go on sayin' it's empty.
Folks'll understand.

866
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:33,957
I'm saying more than that, Captain.

867
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:38,291
- You framed that boy.
- Framed him!

868
00:50:46,499 --> 00:50:48,499
What's the matter with him, Hank?
Is he--is he crazy?

869
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:50,374
Yeah, that must be it. Crazy.

870
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,832
Hank, what are we gonna do with
this Grandi guy? Take him in?

871
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:54,082
- Grandi?
- I, uh--

872
00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:55,499
I think you ought to realize, Quinlan,

873
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,541
if a man of Vargas's position
is willing to testify--

874
00:50:57,707 --> 00:50:59,707
Who you working for?
The Mexican government?

875
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,166
I'm working for the district attorney.

876
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:05,166
Listen, I got a position in this town,
a reputation.

877
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:08,457
- Who's Vargas?
- Vargas is kind of important too, Hank.

878
00:51:08,624 --> 00:51:09,707
- Somebody's gonna have to

879
00:51:09,874 --> 00:51:10,874
give in on this thing.

880
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:13,041
Either that or somebody's gonna be ruined.

881
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:15,957
- Captain Quinlan.
- What do you want?

882
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:19,541
Schwartz, you saw
that shoe box in the bathroom.

883
00:51:19,707 --> 00:51:21,541
You know it was empty.

884
00:51:21,707 --> 00:51:23,999
Well, now, I didn't happen
to see it myself,

885
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:26,457
but...but I believe you.

886
00:51:32,832 --> 00:51:35,874
We are both after
the same exact thing, Captain.

887
00:51:36,249 --> 00:51:39,832
If Vargas goes on like this, shooting
his face off like he was just now--

888
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:42,166
Ah, move along.
Stop making trouble, Grandi.

889
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,666
Trouble? Who's the one
who's making trouble?

890
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,916
Vargas. Sure.

891
00:51:47,082 --> 00:51:49,207
For my brother, Vic, in Mexico City.
For you here.

892
00:51:49,374 --> 00:51:51,374
Ah, go peddle your papers, Uncle Joe.

893
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:55,582
You just said it yourself. Somebody's
reputation has got to be ruined.

894
00:51:56,082 --> 00:51:57,999
Why shouldn't it be Vargas's?

895
00:52:00,207 --> 00:52:01,749
- What are you waiting for?
- Nothing, Hank. I--

896
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:04,457
- We got work to do.
- Okay, Hank, okay.

897
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:07,749
- What do you want?
- Nothing, Captain.

898
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,916
- Nothing that you don't want too.
- Go on. Spit it out, Grandi.

899
00:52:11,082 --> 00:52:14,499
Captain, we cannot
stand out here in the street.

900
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:18,291
Why don't we go somewhere
nice and private, huh?

901
00:52:18,457 --> 00:52:21,332
Where we can sit down and have a drink.

902
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:23,832
I don't drink.

903
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:18,957
- Look, Schwartz.
- Al.

904
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:23,749
Al. We must show where Quinlan himself
got the dynamite.

905
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:26,999
If you're really with me on this,
we have still to get some proof.

906
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:29,791
- We've got your word.
- Let's do better than that.

907
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:33,749
In your country also, when explosives
are purchased, some record is kept, no?

908
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:36,249
Sure. And we're going
to the right place to look it up.

909
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:38,374
Hey. How about Quinlan's ranch?

910
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:40,957
- Where is that?
- Just outside town.

911
00:53:41,124 --> 00:53:42,916
While you're looking up
the dynamite records,

912
00:53:43,082 --> 00:53:44,749
I might go out there.

913
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,374
Al, there is one thing
that worries me still.

914
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:50,332
- What's that?
- I could be wrong about this.

915
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:52,499
That would be very bad for you.

916
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:55,666
Let's see if you're wrong first, amigo.

917
00:54:19,582 --> 00:54:21,791
I wondered if you could
turn that music off.

918
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:28,999
Would it be possible to ask
those people next door to move?

919
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,999
Just to another cabin? You see,
I'm still trying to get some sleep.

920
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,416
Where would you like me to take you, doll?

921
00:54:41,374 --> 00:54:42,874
- You got the stuff?

922
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:44,541
- Hey.

923
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:49,332
I brought this.
Some of the other guys got more.

924
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:51,624
- And the hypo?

925
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,874
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

926
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,832
- Turn that down.

927
00:55:00,749 --> 00:55:02,666
I-I'm...

928
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,957
- the night man.
- Yeah?

929
00:55:05,707 --> 00:55:07,416
Well, you're a little early, ain't you?

930
00:55:07,582 --> 00:55:09,666
I thought I'd better come back,
see if the new--

931
00:55:11,582 --> 00:55:13,499
Okay.

932
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:18,874
Which...

933
00:55:20,207 --> 00:55:21,957
one of you is the new day man?

934
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:25,624
Beat it.

935
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:31,999
It's a mile and a half
down to the highway. I--

936
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,624
I think I'd better stay.

937
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,457
Go in the kitchen and get
yourself something to eat.

938
00:55:45,874 --> 00:55:49,166
- I brought my lunch.
- Eat it now.

939
00:55:50,457 --> 00:55:52,291
Eat it now?

940
00:55:58,957 --> 00:56:02,082
- I know you. You're the Grandi boys.

941
00:56:02,249 --> 00:56:04,166
Your Uncle Joe know you're here?

942
00:56:04,332 --> 00:56:05,916
Who could that be?

943
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:09,291
Take it easy, Pretty Boy.
What are you in such a sweat about?

944
00:56:09,457 --> 00:56:11,291
It's a tough rap to get caught
with this stuff.

945
00:56:11,457 --> 00:56:13,291
It's only that Vargas dame again.

946
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:19,041
- Yes, ma'am?
- <i>Give me State-1212.</i>

947
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:23,249
Very good, ma'am. State-1212.

948
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:29,124
Hey! Hey! That's the police department.

949
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:30,291
- Yeah?
- Huh?

950
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:31,624
It's the police, all right.

951
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:34,499
- What do we do now?
- We do nothing...

952
00:56:35,249 --> 00:56:37,457
but relax and have ourselves a ball.

953
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:42,791
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Vargas,

954
00:56:42,957 --> 00:56:45,499
but the telephone
is temporarily out of service.

955
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:48,374
I'll call you
just as soon as it's repaired.

956
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,166
I better call Uncle Joe.

957
00:57:05,707 --> 00:57:08,874
So that is our little arrangement, see?

958
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:12,791
- A real sweet setup.

959
00:57:12,957 --> 00:57:15,582
- And all the help we need--
- Listen, you knock somebody off--

960
00:57:15,749 --> 00:57:18,124
- I don't care who it is,

961
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:20,582
- there won't be any "little arrangement.”
- <i>Hola.</i>

962
00:57:20,749 --> 00:57:22,916
- Not with Hank Quinlan.
- Joe, it's for you.

963
00:57:23,082 --> 00:57:25,749
- Yeah.
- Vargas can't hurt me.

964
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:27,457
Well, maybe not.

965
00:57:28,457 --> 00:57:31,874
But maybe with our little deal,
we can hurt him.

966
00:57:32,332 --> 00:57:34,374
I don't make deals.

967
00:57:38,957 --> 00:57:41,374
Yeah? Well, sure, I'm all right.

968
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,999
No, no, no. Just go ahead like I said.

969
00:57:44,374 --> 00:57:46,999
- Don't worry. No matter--
- Something wrong out there?

970
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:50,541
- No, no. Nothing we can't fix.
- We? Where you get that "we" stuff?

971
00:57:50,874 --> 00:57:52,499
I haven't given you any answer yet.

972
00:57:54,499 --> 00:57:58,707
You keep talking as though
this was some kind of a deal

973
00:57:58,874 --> 00:58:01,541
where I ask you to get me out of a rap.

974
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:04,249
No. That ain't it at all.

975
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:07,582
In this thing, we're partners, see?

976
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:10,874
- Shall we drink to that?
- I don't--

977
00:58:16,374 --> 00:58:19,624
Juanito, two more double bourbons.

978
00:58:25,332 --> 00:58:27,124
Make 'em nice and big.

979
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:51,749
All I can say is,
this better be important.

980
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:53,124
It is.

981
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:55,666
I think we're out of our minds
to be here in Mexico at all.

982
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,749
- Well, Vargas. You sent for us.
- Mr. Adair.

983
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:02,332
Gentlemen. Now, it isn't really true
that I sent for you.

984
00:59:02,499 --> 00:59:04,832
- Mr. Schwartz insisted that--
- Let's get down to cases.

985
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,207
You know Chief Gould,
of course, Mr. Vargas.

986
00:59:06,374 --> 00:59:08,707
- How do you do, sir?
- Where's this so-called document?

987
00:59:08,874 --> 00:59:10,999
- Perhaps we'd better go to my room.
- Yes, by all means, yes.

988
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:13,082
- In here, gentlemen.
- Go ahead.

989
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,624
- No, no, no. I'll--I'll walk.
- Okay.

990
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,624
The lift is rather small, I'm afraid.

991
00:59:17,957 --> 00:59:19,749
Chief Gould.

992
00:59:21,499 --> 00:59:24,249
Just, uh, press the button
for the second floor.

993
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:25,666
I'll meet you there.

994
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:30,082
I still don't know why Vargas couldn't
come to my office.

995
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:33,582
He has practically cabinet status with
the Mexican government, you know.

996
00:59:33,749 --> 00:59:35,457
Well, if he's so important--

997
00:59:35,624 --> 00:59:37,666
He can't very well make a formal call
on either of you

998
00:59:37,832 --> 00:59:39,291
without at least going
through his consulate

999
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:41,249
and putting the whole thing
on an international level.

1000
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:44,082
Okay. Cut out all the fancy talk
and what does it boil down to?

1001
00:59:44,249 --> 00:59:45,916
This Mexican is bringing criminal charges

1002
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,957
against one of the most respected
police officers in the country.

1003
00:59:49,124 --> 00:59:51,082
And that's what it boils down to.

1004
00:59:51,332 --> 00:59:54,916
Ah-- Well, Vargas. You must be
pretty quick on your feet.

1005
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,499
It's just that the lift is slow.
This way, gentlemen.

1006
00:59:57,666 --> 00:59:58,916
Thank you.

1007
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:06,291
After you.

1008
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:10,707
I have it right over here.

1009
01:00:13,832 --> 01:00:16,416
There. While you're looking at it,

1010
01:00:16,582 --> 01:00:19,624
perhaps you'll excuse me
if I finish a call I've put in.

1011
01:00:20,082 --> 01:00:22,416
- Where'd you get this?

1012
01:00:22,832 --> 01:00:25,582
- From your department of records--
- They'll let anybody in there.

1013
01:00:25,749 --> 01:00:28,416
- Well, it doesn't mean anything.
- El senor Vargas, Si.

1014
01:00:28,582 --> 01:00:29,957
That's your wife you're calling, isn't it?

1015
01:00:30,124 --> 01:00:31,499
- Yes.
- You know who owns the Mirador?

1016
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:33,166
- No, I don't.
- "June 18.

1017
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:35,457
Hill's Hardware in Los Robles.

1018
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:40,207
17 sticks, Black Fox Brand,
to H. Quinlan."

1019
01:00:40,374 --> 01:00:42,499
Quinlan needed dynamite
for work on his ranch.

1020
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:43,707
Simple coincidence.

1021
01:00:44,124 --> 01:00:46,041
Mr. Adair-- Hello?

1022
01:00:49,999 --> 01:00:50,999
Yes?

1023
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:55,624
Mirador? My name is Vargas.
I'd like to speak with my wife, please.

1024
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:59,457
<i>I'm very sorry, Mr. Vargas,
but your wife left definite instructions.</i>

1025
01:00:59,624 --> 01:01:01,249
She's not to be disturbed.

1026
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:10,582
Honey. You, in the next room.

1027
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:12,791
What is it?

1028
01:01:13,707 --> 01:01:16,124
Come to the wall so I can whisper.

1029
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:22,291
Yes?

1030
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:27,082
You know what the boys
are trying to do, don't you?

1031
01:01:29,874 --> 01:01:32,374
They are tr yin' to get in there.

1032
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:34,999
They went to get the master key.

1033
01:01:36,582 --> 01:01:39,249
You know what marijuana is, don't you?

1034
01:01:42,457 --> 01:01:43,624
Yes.

1035
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:47,041
You know what a Mary Jane is?

1036
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:52,082
You know what a mainliner is?

1037
01:01:55,541 --> 01:01:59,291
I think so. But what's that
got to do with me?

1038
01:02:00,541 --> 01:02:03,457
It will make you feel real good.

1039
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,624
You're trying to tell me
these boys are drugged?

1040
01:02:08,082 --> 01:02:10,624
- Is that why--
- Shh.

1041
01:02:11,707 --> 01:02:14,124
Hey, you--you think they're ready
for that stuff yet?

1042
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:18,374
Not yet, kid.

1043
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:24,166
The fun is only beginning.

1044
01:02:26,457 --> 01:02:28,374
Hank, I've been looking
for ya in every bar in town.

1045
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:30,041
Yeah, I've been in half of 'em,

1046
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:33,457
but only here
on the wrong side of the border.

1047
01:02:34,499 --> 01:02:35,999
I never drink on my own beat.

1048
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,957
Bartender, give him
some black coffee, quick.

1049
01:02:38,124 --> 01:02:39,874
- He's called a meeting, Hank.
- I don't need black coffee.

1050
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:42,541
- Meeting?
- Vargas, at his hotel.

1051
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:45,541
- Motel?
- No, right here across the street.

1052
01:02:45,707 --> 01:02:48,874
- Well, I don't need any coffee. Not yet.
- Not yet?

1053
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:51,291
This is a swell time to be gettin' fried,

1054
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:52,749
- I must say.
- My job's over, Pete.

1055
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:54,666
- You oughta be over at the department--
- Now, listen, Hank.

1056
01:02:54,832 --> 01:02:55,832
...workin' on Sanchez. We gotta break--

1057
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,374
Vargas is telling the chief and the DA
that you planted that dynamite.

1058
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,582
- He was a fool.
- They're takin' him seriously.

1059
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,332
- They came to him.
- No, I mean Sanchez.

1060
01:03:03,499 --> 01:03:05,332
Dynamite's no way to kill.

1061
01:03:05,499 --> 01:03:07,666
Did I ever tell you
the smart way to kill, Pete?

1062
01:03:07,832 --> 01:03:09,707
- Sure. Sure. Strangling.

1063
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:13,082
- Clean. Silent.
- You told me all that.

1064
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:14,999
- That's how my wife died.
- Come on. Finish that coffee.

1065
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,291
- I don't usually talk about my wife.
- Never when you're sober.

1066
01:03:20,082 --> 01:03:22,499
- She was strangled, Pete.
- I know. I know.

1067
01:03:23,082 --> 01:03:25,207
Bindin' cord. She was workin'
up at the packin' plant,

1068
01:03:25,374 --> 01:03:26,874
so the killer had it right to hand.

1069
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:31,457
Smart. You don't leave fingerprints
on a piece of string.

1070
01:03:31,624 --> 01:03:33,124
Bartender, what do I owe you?

1071
01:03:33,582 --> 01:03:35,416
That half-breed done it,
of course, we all knew that.

1072
01:03:35,582 --> 01:03:37,791
- But I was just a rookie cop.

1073
01:03:37,957 --> 01:03:39,374
4.75.

1074
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:42,999
I followed around after him
eating my heart out,

1075
01:03:44,582 --> 01:03:46,291
tr yin' to catch him.

1076
01:03:46,832 --> 01:03:48,082
But I never did.

1077
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:53,874
Then in some mudhole in Belgium,
the good Lord done the job for me in 1917.

1078
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:57,707
Pete, that was the last killer
ever got out of my hands.

1079
01:03:57,874 --> 01:03:59,457
- Where are you going now?
- Where do you think?

1080
01:03:59,624 --> 01:04:00,832
To Senor Vargas's meeting.

1081
01:04:00,999 --> 01:04:02,957
He wants to fight dirty. Okay.

1082
01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:05,832
- That's the kind of fight he's gonna get.

1083
01:04:05,999 --> 01:04:07,457
- Perhaps--
- Perhaps what?

1084
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:10,166
Perhaps he honestly thinks
that Sanchez is guilty.

1085
01:04:10,332 --> 01:04:12,499
- Of course he does.
- There's no "perhaps” about it.

1086
01:04:12,874 --> 01:04:15,832
- Hank Quinlan is an honest cop.
- There are all kinds of policemen, sir.

1087
01:04:15,999 --> 01:04:18,041
- Oh!
- I don't have to tell you that.

1088
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:20,166
- A few take bribes--
- Hank Quinlan

1089
01:04:20,332 --> 01:04:21,332
never took a dollar in his life.

1090
01:04:21,499 --> 01:04:24,749
Most are honest, yes.
But even some of the honest men

1091
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:27,749
abuse their power in other ways.

1092
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:29,832
Come in, Hank.

1093
01:04:32,124 --> 01:04:33,249
Well, I...

1094
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:36,874
don't know whether I'm welcome or not.

1095
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:39,916
- I want you to hear this.

1096
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,332
I've heard it already.

1097
01:04:43,582 --> 01:04:47,166
Our friend Vargas has some very special
ideas about police procedure.

1098
01:04:47,332 --> 01:04:49,624
He seems to think it don't matter
whether a killer is hanged or not,

1099
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,832
so long as we obey
the fine print in rule books.

1100
01:04:51,999 --> 01:04:54,332
Captain, I don't think a policeman
should work like a dogcatcher.

1101
01:04:54,499 --> 01:04:56,916
- No?
- Putting criminals behind bars. No.

1102
01:04:57,249 --> 01:05:00,666
In any free country, a policeman
is supposed to enforce the law.

1103
01:05:00,874 --> 01:05:02,666
And the law protects the guilty,
as well as the innocent.

1104
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,624
Our job is tough enough--

1105
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:06,791
It's supposed to be. It has to be tough.

1106
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:09,916
A policeman's job is only easy
in a police state.

1107
01:05:10,082 --> 01:05:11,957
That's the whole point, Captain.

1108
01:05:12,124 --> 01:05:14,332
Who is the boss? The cop or the law?

1109
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:17,124
- Where's your wife, Vargas?
- What do you--

1110
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:20,041
What do you mean? You know
where she is as well as I do.

1111
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,666
Sergeant Menzies drove her.
She's at the motel.

1112
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:26,332
Oh? And you're still here?

1113
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:29,541
Yes, I'm checking out now and joining her.
Do you have

1114
01:05:29,707 --> 01:05:31,291
- a reason for asking, Captain?
- No. No, no, no.

1115
01:05:31,457 --> 01:05:33,707
I had no special reason. No.

1116
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:36,166
No, I just wondered.

1117
01:05:37,374 --> 01:05:41,082
Well, what do you know?
A mother pigeon and her nest.

1118
01:05:41,666 --> 01:05:43,499
Pigeon egg. Eh?

1119
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:46,541
Captain, you did buy
17 sticks of dynamite, didn't you?

1120
01:05:46,707 --> 01:05:50,207
You tell your story, Vargas.
I don't have to answer your questions.

1121
01:05:50,374 --> 01:05:52,332
- A hired hand at your ranch says--
- My ranch?

1122
01:05:52,499 --> 01:05:53,999
...he used 15 sticks.

1123
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:58,582
You been spying out at my ranch?

1124
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:01,707
- A foreigner.
- Without my knowledge, Hank.

1125
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,041
- Without my permission.
- At your ranch,

1126
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:05,624
you used 15 sticks of dynamite, Quinlan.
That leaves two sticks missing.

1127
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:08,041
And two sticks
were found in that shoe box.

1128
01:06:08,207 --> 01:06:10,249
He's just asking, Hank. Hank!

1129
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,957
- What's that for?
- It's for--

1130
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:17,166
- It's for letting him ask.
- Oh, Hank. Wait a minute.

1131
01:06:17,332 --> 01:06:21,291
30 years. 30 years of
poundin' beats and ridin' cars.

1132
01:06:21,457 --> 01:06:23,124
30 years of dirt and crummy pay.

1133
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:25,916
- 30 years I gave my life--
- Hank, watch your blood pressure.

1134
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,624
...and you allow this foreigner
to accuse me?

1135
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:29,457
We were giving you a chance to answer him.

1136
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:31,791
Answer? Why do I have to answer him?
No, sir!

1137
01:06:32,124 --> 01:06:37,166
I won't take back that badge until
the people of this county vote it back!

1138
01:06:37,332 --> 01:06:39,332
- Oh.
- Hank, will you listen a minute?

1139
01:06:39,749 --> 01:06:43,624
I don't want to ever see that man in
headquarters for any reason at any time!

1140
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,499
- Now, you backed him up.
- Me?

1141
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,582
You stood by while he impugned
the integrity

1142
01:06:47,749 --> 01:06:49,707
- of Captain Quinlan and Sergeant Menzies!
- I tried to stop him!

1143
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:54,207
Do you realize what Vargas has done?
He's smearing hundreds of fine men.

1144
01:06:54,374 --> 01:06:55,832
Men ready to give their
lives to protect the people.

1145
01:06:55,999 --> 01:06:57,332
Have you caused enough trouble?

1146
01:06:57,499 --> 01:06:59,749
Are you satisfied?
I want you to apologize.

1147
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:01,499
- To Quinlan?
- And to Chief Gould.

1148
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:03,124
Would you like me to get down on my knees?

1149
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:04,707
If you have any decency, you will, yes.

1150
01:07:04,874 --> 01:07:06,374
- You'll crawl!
- Mr. Adair,

1151
01:07:06,582 --> 01:07:09,874
I won't give you the chance
to test your authority in this matter.

1152
01:07:14,999 --> 01:07:18,832
Al, have I still any credit left with you?

1153
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:20,832
Some.

1154
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:25,166
Tell me, where can I find the records
of Quinlan's old cases?

1155
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,957
- I'll show you.
- I'd like to get back to my wife.

1156
01:07:28,124 --> 01:07:29,874
I hope this won't take too long.

1157
01:07:30,749 --> 01:07:31,749
- Hank?
- Huh?

1158
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:33,624
You're not going without this.

1159
01:07:41,082 --> 01:07:42,499
Well,

1160
01:07:43,374 --> 01:07:44,916
now I guess I can talk.

1161
01:07:45,916 --> 01:07:48,749
- What do you mean, Hank?
- Well, all I wanted to tell you was

1162
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:51,457
- I couldn't really say in my own defense.
- Go on, Hank.

1163
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:54,749
What do you really know about this Vargas?

1164
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:57,874
Isn't he in charge of some kind of cleanup
here on this side of the border?

1165
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:00,082
- Narcotics, mainly?
- Yeah.

1166
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:01,749
Narcotics.

1167
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,124
He's a drug addict.

1168
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:07,166
He's got that young wife
of his hooked too.

1169
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:09,916
But good.

1170
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:12,624
If I hadn't seen that hypodermic myself--

1171
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:13,957
Hypodermic? You saw it?

1172
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:15,707
I just said so, didn't 1?

1173
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,791
I saw it.

1174
01:08:18,124 --> 01:08:20,957
That's how come he happened to imagine
all those crazy things.

1175
01:08:21,124 --> 01:08:22,291
It's typical.

1176
01:08:23,124 --> 01:08:26,499
That's what that wife of his was doin'
in that dive on skid row.

1177
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:27,832
Both a couple of junkies.

1178
01:08:27,999 --> 01:08:32,082
Of course, he's usin' the job...
as a cover-up.

1179
01:08:33,499 --> 01:08:35,332
You don't mean he's mixed up
in this dope racket himself.

1180
01:08:35,499 --> 01:08:36,499
Mm-hmm.

1181
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:38,957
Hank, if this is
just one of your hunches--

1182
01:08:39,124 --> 01:08:41,291
I don't ask you to believe it.
I can prove it.

1183
01:08:41,457 --> 01:08:43,499
I know it isn't my department, but...

1184
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:48,791
I'd like to show you I'm not talkin'
out of the back of my neck.

1185
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:52,499
- Just be careful, huh?
- Chief, I'll be very careful.

1186
01:08:55,291 --> 01:08:59,124
This takes guts, Al.
Standing up to your boss this way.

1187
01:08:59,499 --> 01:09:02,124
After today, amigo,
you can do me a favor.

1188
01:09:02,499 --> 01:09:04,624
- Help me look for an office.
- How's that?

1189
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:08,416
Hank Quinlan's famous intuition might
still turn out to be better than yours.

1190
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:12,874
If so, my intuition tells me
I'll be going back to private practice.

1191
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,999
Here are the other names
you want. Booker, Boul--

1192
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:19,124
- Look, Al, I can finish this alone.
- Yes, and maybe you can't.

1193
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:22,832
Well, let me try anyway.

1194
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:26,166
I have no right to drag you
further into this.

1195
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:27,666
Gonna do it alone, huh?

1196
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:29,249
All you gotta do
is solve the murder

1197
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:33,332
and also prove that the idol of
the police force is a fraud.

1198
01:09:33,707 --> 01:09:37,374
Amigo, you've got your work
really cut out for you.

1199
01:10:25,124 --> 01:10:28,249
Hello, Tana? Is Captain Quinlan there?

1200
01:10:28,832 --> 01:10:29,832
Now, Sergeant--

1201
01:10:29,999 --> 01:10:32,541
Tana. Hey, Tana!

1202
01:10:32,707 --> 01:10:34,499
I'll be right there.

1203
01:10:35,957 --> 01:10:38,207
Now what would Hank Quinlan be doing here?

1204
01:10:38,957 --> 01:10:40,832
Used to be he'd hole up
at your place

1205
01:10:40,999 --> 01:10:42,957
for two or three days
with a case of whiskey.

1206
01:10:43,124 --> 01:10:46,749
That was years ago.
Now he's on candy bars.

1207
01:10:47,124 --> 01:10:49,332
- Not tonight he isn't.

1208
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:45,582
Lia.

1209
01:11:45,999 --> 01:11:48,791
No, let me stay. I want to watch.

1210
01:11:50,832 --> 01:11:52,041
Hold her legs.

1211
01:11:54,624 --> 01:11:57,166
No! No! Let me go!

1212
01:11:57,332 --> 01:11:59,332
Don't touch me! Let me go!

1213
01:11:59,499 --> 01:12:01,457
No! No! No!

1214
01:12:01,624 --> 01:12:03,374
- Close the door!

1215
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:18,749
So, this is where you've been
all afternoon. Hmm?

1216
01:12:20,457 --> 01:12:22,041
How'd they let you in here?

1217
01:12:22,749 --> 01:12:23,749
A foreigner?

1218
01:12:24,249 --> 01:12:27,082
The hall of records
is open to the public, Sergeant.

1219
01:12:27,582 --> 01:12:30,291
- What are you doin'?
- You'll find out tomorrow morning.

1220
01:12:30,457 --> 01:12:32,207
I want to know now.

1221
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:40,041
What's all this?

1222
01:12:40,332 --> 01:12:44,874
Records of every case where you or
Quinlan uncovered the principal evidence.

1223
01:12:45,332 --> 01:12:47,624
In each case, as you'll notice,

1224
01:12:48,374 --> 01:12:50,916
the defense denied
the existence of that evidence.

1225
01:12:52,249 --> 01:12:54,416
What are you tr yin' to do, wreck him?

1226
01:12:54,957 --> 01:12:56,291
Him?

1227
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:57,916
What about you?

1228
01:12:59,207 --> 01:13:02,166
Are you telling me you never
planted any evidence, Sergeant?

1229
01:13:02,332 --> 01:13:04,957
Of course not. Neither did Hank.

1230
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:06,541
- It's all there.
- Never!

1231
01:13:06,707 --> 01:13:08,207
The ax in the Berger slaying.

1232
01:13:08,374 --> 01:13:09,874
The--the dentures in the Ewell case.

1233
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:12,332
Planting evidence, framing suspects.

1234
01:13:12,499 --> 01:13:15,166
- That's a lie.
- I think I can prove it, Sergeant.

1235
01:13:15,332 --> 01:13:17,999
Sure. You can smear him.

1236
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:21,374
Ruin his whole life's work.

1237
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:24,207
Vargas, I--

1238
01:13:25,082 --> 01:13:26,832
I don't even know where he is.

1239
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:28,957
That's what you've done to him.

1240
01:13:29,249 --> 01:13:31,291
- What I've done to him?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1241
01:13:32,249 --> 01:13:35,666
He's on an important case, and...
he's disappeared.

1242
01:13:36,832 --> 01:13:38,457
Good and drunk, probably.

1243
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:42,374
After 12 years on the wagon.

1244
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:45,082
That's what you've done to him.

1245
01:13:49,707 --> 01:13:51,207
What about Quinlan, Sergeant?

1246
01:13:52,582 --> 01:13:53,791
What's he done?

1247
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:58,666
What about all those people
he put in the death house?

1248
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:02,457
Save your tears for them.

1249
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:11,666
♪ When the roll
is called up yonder ♪

1250
01:14:11,832 --> 01:14:14,457

1253
01:14:25,957 --> 01:14:27,916
What seems to be the trouble?

1254
01:14:28,082 --> 01:14:29,624
- Trouble?
- The lights.

1255
01:14:30,582 --> 01:14:32,707
The lights seem to be out
in all the cabins.

1256
01:14:32,874 --> 01:14:34,832
Yeah. Yes.

1257
01:14:36,457 --> 01:14:40,124
Somebody's been monkeyin'
with them fuses.

1258
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:42,166
They think I'm gonna fix 'em,

1259
01:14:42,332 --> 01:14:44,166
they--they--they got another thing comin'.

1260
01:14:44,332 --> 01:14:46,707
It ain't my job to fix 'em,
even if I know how.

1261
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:48,624
- I'm the night man.
- Could you show me, please,

1262
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:50,291
to my wife's cabin?

1263
01:14:53,707 --> 01:14:55,416
No.

1264
01:14:55,582 --> 01:14:58,082
There--there isn't nobody here.

1265
01:14:58,874 --> 01:15:00,832
You must be mistaken, sir.

1266
01:15:00,999 --> 01:15:04,874
My wife has been registered here
since this morning.

1267
01:15:06,374 --> 01:15:07,999
My name is Vargas.

1268
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:12,374
- Vargas?
- Would you look, please, in the register?

1269
01:15:12,749 --> 01:15:14,791
Register?

1270
01:15:15,499 --> 01:15:16,832
Well--

1271
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:25,957
- Um, that might be cabin six.
- Possibly.

1272
01:15:26,666 --> 01:15:29,166
- Maybe seven.
- Yes. Here.

1273
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:38,916
May I?

1274
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:44,582
There's... nobody been
registered all week.

1275
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:48,999
No. No, it--it--it's...off the season.

1276
01:15:49,874 --> 01:15:52,957
Nobody hardly ever comes around at all.

1277
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:55,624
I-I-I'm the night man.

1278
01:16:03,874 --> 01:16:05,999
There was that party.

1279
01:16:07,082 --> 01:16:08,624
Party? What party?

1280
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:14,332
- It's a mess. Awful mess.
- Where?

1281
01:16:14,624 --> 01:16:17,249
They think I'm gonna clean it up,
they got another thing comin'.

1282
01:16:17,832 --> 01:16:19,624
Terrible, terrible brawl.

1283
01:16:23,457 --> 01:16:24,916
Cabin number seven.

1284
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,249
Right in the middle of the afternoon.

1285
01:16:29,874 --> 01:16:31,374
Cabin number seven.

1286
01:16:40,207 --> 01:16:44,374
This brawl, you mean there was
some sort of a fight?

1287
01:16:45,582 --> 01:16:46,707
- Fight?
- Yes.

1288
01:16:47,749 --> 01:16:51,082
No. No. It wasn't that...kind of a brawl.

1289
01:16:54,499 --> 01:16:57,166
It was--

1290
01:16:57,666 --> 01:16:59,707
One of them wild parties.

1291
01:16:59,874 --> 01:17:01,082
You know the kind?

1292
01:17:21,249 --> 01:17:23,374
This can't be my wife's room.

1293
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,082
This ain't her clothes, huh?

1294
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:28,041
- Phew! It stinks in here!

1295
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:32,791
Let's get some air in here. Phew!

1296
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:39,624
It's a mess. It's a stinkin' mess!
Havin' a wild party.

1297
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:42,249
But, here's my briefcase.
I left it with Susan. It--

1298
01:17:44,499 --> 01:17:46,166
Uh, stub here.

1299
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:51,749
I'm gettin' out of here.

1300
01:17:53,124 --> 01:17:54,499
My gun!

1301
01:17:56,832 --> 01:17:59,082
- You haven't been here?

1302
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:00,832
You haven't been in that room?

1303
01:18:01,124 --> 01:18:03,541
I--I just looked in.

1304
01:18:03,707 --> 01:18:05,541
I had a gun in this case!

1305
01:18:06,957 --> 01:18:10,582
- You didn't take it?
- What would I want with a gun?

1306
01:18:11,207 --> 01:18:12,957
Well, somebody wanted it!

1307
01:18:14,832 --> 01:18:17,582
If they hadn't put that Grandi boy
on the desk this morning,

1308
01:18:17,749 --> 01:18:18,874
none of this would have happened.

1309
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:20,041
Grandi?

1310
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:23,291
Wh--who do you think
this belongs to anyway?

1311
01:18:23,457 --> 01:18:26,457
- Where are they?

1312
01:18:26,624 --> 01:18:28,291
- The kids?
- Yes.

1313
01:18:28,874 --> 01:18:30,499
- Please.

1314
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:32,249
Rancho!

1315
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,666
- Rancho Grande?
- Yeah!

1316
01:19:08,832 --> 01:19:11,207
- You got her undressed?
- Yeah. We've scattered more

1317
01:19:11,374 --> 01:19:12,707
reefer stubs around.

1318
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:16,624
You kids didn't use none of
that stuff yourselves, huh?

1319
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:18,291
Think we're crazy?

1320
01:19:18,749 --> 01:19:21,207
Nobody in the Grandi family gets hooked.

1321
01:19:21,582 --> 01:19:23,082
Understand? That's the rule.

1322
01:19:23,332 --> 01:19:25,374
We blew the smoke in her clothes,
that's all.

1323
01:19:25,541 --> 01:19:28,457
Like you said, we put on
a good show to scare her.

1324
01:19:29,249 --> 01:19:30,999
Let's hope it was good enough.

1325
01:19:32,082 --> 01:19:35,916
When she wakes up, she's gotta think maybe
something really did happen.

1326
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:38,416
All right, now, beat it.

1327
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,207
What about our dough?

1328
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:43,291
We were not doing this for fun, Uncle Joe.

1329
01:19:43,457 --> 01:19:46,124
Beat it. Beat it. You're gonna
get your dough tomorrow.

1330
01:19:46,499 --> 01:19:48,707
- Okay.
- Beat it.

1331
01:20:05,124 --> 01:20:06,541
Psst!

1332
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:09,749
Okay.

1333
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:31,749
- Turn out the light.
- Why?

1334
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:37,624
Nobody can see you up here.

1335
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:42,499
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

1336
01:20:49,541 --> 01:20:51,457
- Hey, what are you doing?

1337
01:20:53,207 --> 01:20:54,624
I brought you up here for a reason.

1338
01:20:54,999 --> 01:20:56,291
I don't get it.

1339
01:20:57,916 --> 01:21:00,749
I don't even see why you
wanted us to bring her...

1340
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:03,416
all the way into town here.

1341
01:21:04,124 --> 01:21:06,124
I couldn't drive out to the motel.

1342
01:21:06,999 --> 01:21:08,791
- My car is known.
- So what?

1343
01:21:08,957 --> 01:21:10,207
You're a cop making an arrest.

1344
01:21:10,374 --> 01:21:12,166
Oh, the vice boys will do that.

1345
01:21:13,124 --> 01:21:14,582
What's that for?

1346
01:21:21,457 --> 01:21:22,541
Turn around.

1347
01:21:27,707 --> 01:21:29,041
Get the phone.

1348
01:21:29,957 --> 01:21:30,957
The phone.

1349
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:37,332
Now dial 1212.

1350
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:40,416
- That's the police station.
- Go on. Dial it.

1351
01:21:43,082 --> 01:21:46,624
- Stop, Quinlan. You're drunk.

1352
01:21:46,791 --> 01:21:49,666
- Just stop and think for a minute.

1353
01:21:51,666 --> 01:21:53,166
See if they answer.

1354
01:21:56,957 --> 01:22:00,041
- Hello?
- Ask for Sergeant Menzies.

1355
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:01,874
Menzies.

1356
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:04,207
Sergeant Menzies.

1357
01:22:07,082 --> 01:22:09,291
Quinlan, if you turn me in,

1358
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:11,332
I'll have quite a story to tell.

1359
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:15,082
Yeah, you sure will.

1360
01:22:16,082 --> 01:22:17,416
See if Menzies is--

1361
01:22:17,957 --> 01:22:19,582
Hello? Menzies?

1362
01:22:19,749 --> 01:22:22,332
Got him? Hand me the phone.

1363
01:22:22,999 --> 01:22:25,916
Hold it so I can talk to him. Give me
the receiver. Give me the receiver.

1364
01:22:27,082 --> 01:22:28,291
Hello, Pete?

1365
01:22:30,374 --> 01:22:32,582
Of course it's me, partner.

1366
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:34,374
Any news yet?

1367
01:22:35,207 --> 01:22:36,832
Sanchez still hasn't broken.

1368
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:40,374
What?

1369
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:44,541
Vargas's wife? A narcotics rap?

1370
01:22:44,707 --> 01:22:48,999
Oh, one of the boys who was on
this wild party gave me the buzz, see?

1371
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:54,457
Uh, just relay it to the vice boys
as anonymous.

1372
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:57,707
The Hotel Ritz. Room 18.

1373
01:22:58,582 --> 01:23:00,999
The way I hear it,
things got a little out of control.

1374
01:23:01,166 --> 01:23:04,124
Don't be surprised...what they find.

1375
01:23:05,207 --> 01:23:08,707
But what about me, Hank? What do I do?

1376
01:23:08,957 --> 01:23:11,374
Keep after him. Break him! Break him!

1377
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:16,041
- Put up the phone.

1378
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,457
Receiver.

1379
01:23:20,124 --> 01:23:21,457
Give me the key.

1380
01:23:35,082 --> 01:23:37,332
Told ya I brought ya up here for a reason.

1381
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:11,041
No! No!

1382
01:24:11,249 --> 01:24:13,499
Hank! Hank!

1383
01:24:34,374 --> 01:24:36,832
No. No, don't!

1384
01:25:26,999 --> 01:25:29,541
Help! Somebody help me!

1385
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:34,457
Help! Somebody come up here!

1386
01:25:39,207 --> 01:25:40,707
Help me!

1387
01:25:57,374 --> 01:25:59,249
- <i>¡Vamos!</i>
- Mike!

1388
01:26:02,499 --> 01:26:05,124
Mike! Mike!

1389
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:35,832
Oh, talk English, can't you?

1390
01:27:35,999 --> 01:27:38,749
Listen, I'm no cop now. I'm a husband.

1391
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:40,332
What did you do with her?

1392
01:27:40,749 --> 01:27:43,332
Where is my wife? My wife!

1393
01:28:01,082 --> 01:28:02,124
Vargas!

1394
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:04,624
It's your wife, Vargas.

1395
01:28:05,624 --> 01:28:06,707
They picked her up.

1396
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,499
What do you mean, "Picked her up?"

1397
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:11,166
The vice squad.

1398
01:28:12,416 --> 01:28:13,416
Quinlan?

1399
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,916
You better come outside with me, amigo.

1400
01:28:22,707 --> 01:28:24,207
No, no. Tell me what happened.

1401
01:28:24,374 --> 01:28:28,082
They found her at the Hotel Ritz,
half-naked on one of the beds, drugged.

1402
01:28:28,749 --> 01:28:30,832
There were reefer stubs and a heroin fix.

1403
01:28:31,249 --> 01:28:32,541
Vargas!

1404
01:28:33,124 --> 01:28:35,666
The charge isn't just
possession of narcotics.

1405
01:28:35,999 --> 01:28:37,249
What is it then?

1406
01:28:37,541 --> 01:28:40,374
- Murder.
- Murder?

1407
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:58,999
Susie. Susie.

1408
01:28:59,332 --> 01:29:03,041
- Darling, it's all right now. Susie, Su--

1409
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:09,124
It's all down in the report.
They found evidence of a mixed party.

1410
01:29:10,499 --> 01:29:11,499
Mixed party?

1411
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:15,207
Articles of clothing,
half-smoked reefers, needle marks.

1412
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:17,582
Something else
could produce the same effects.

1413
01:29:17,749 --> 01:29:20,457
Demerol, for instance,
or sodium pentothal.

1414
01:29:20,624 --> 01:29:24,624
- You could smell the stuff on her.
- This whole setup stinks.

1415
01:29:24,874 --> 01:29:26,707
Who the hell does Quinlan think he is,

1416
01:29:26,874 --> 01:29:29,082
hanging a murder rap on my wife?

1417
01:29:29,624 --> 01:29:31,582
Mike. Mike.

1418
01:29:31,749 --> 01:29:33,832
- Susie, lie down.
- Mike.

1419
01:29:33,999 --> 01:29:36,624
- Now, now. It's all right, Susie.
- Mike.

1420
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:39,332
- Mike, take me home.
- Yes.

1421
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:41,291
- Mike.
- Susie.

1422
01:29:41,666 --> 01:29:44,582
Susie, forgive me.

1423
01:29:49,957 --> 01:29:51,082
Mike!

1424
01:29:52,832 --> 01:29:55,666
- Don't go.
- I'm right here, Susie.

1425
01:29:56,249 --> 01:29:57,249
It's all right.

1426
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:21,916
You understand, Vargas,

1427
01:30:22,082 --> 01:30:23,957
there's no formal charge
against your wife.

1428
01:30:24,124 --> 01:30:25,499
- Oh?
- Even the vice boys

1429
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:26,666
are not pressing anything.

1430
01:30:26,832 --> 01:30:30,499
Oh, the fact that Susan won't actually
serve time makes everything all right.

1431
01:30:30,666 --> 01:30:32,999
- Is that it?
- I told ya I got somethin' to show ya!

1432
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:36,957
Her family, her good name. Nothing's
been touched by all this...filth.

1433
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,499
I found it in the hotel room.

1434
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,832
Yeah.

1435
01:31:07,791 --> 01:31:09,457
With Grandi's body.

1436
01:32:08,332 --> 01:32:09,999
He's still just sitting in there.

1437
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:12,416
- Here, give me that.
- We've been waiting three hours already.

1438
01:32:12,582 --> 01:32:15,124
We won't get a word outta this
as long as he's near that piano.

1439
01:32:16,166 --> 01:32:18,832
If you would just...
go in and shut it off.

1440
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:20,791
He'll never stand for that.

1441
01:32:21,124 --> 01:32:23,499
- I have to get him out of there.
- Give me the microphone.

1442
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:26,916
- Vargas, I can take care of this thing.
- Not without me.

1443
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:31,582
I was just checking with the department.
You know that Grandi kid we picked up?

1444
01:32:31,916 --> 01:32:34,166
- Stand quietly.
- He started to talk.

1445
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:36,582
He says the kids were all faking.

1446
01:32:36,749 --> 01:32:38,207
- Here's the antenna.
- They--they didn't give your wife

1447
01:32:38,374 --> 01:32:39,374
any real dope.

1448
01:32:40,541 --> 01:32:42,916
The doc says it was only that truth stuff.

1449
01:32:43,207 --> 01:32:45,874
- Sodium pentothal.
- Yeah. No harm in it at all.

1450
01:32:46,291 --> 01:32:47,374
No harm?

1451
01:32:47,541 --> 01:32:50,291
Schwartz is driving
your car across the border.

1452
01:32:50,832 --> 01:32:52,874
I told him we'll be by the bridge here.

1453
01:32:53,457 --> 01:32:55,082
He's bringing your wife along.

1454
01:32:55,874 --> 01:32:57,041
She's feeling fine.

1455
01:32:57,666 --> 01:32:59,957
- The doc says she can travel.
- Sergeant--

1456
01:33:00,124 --> 01:33:03,207
Look, all she wants is to catch
the early plane outta here.

1457
01:33:03,374 --> 01:33:05,791
How can I leave here
until my wife's name is clean?

1458
01:33:06,249 --> 01:33:09,249
Clean! What do you think
you're carrying that microphone for?

1459
01:33:09,749 --> 01:33:11,457
Now, remember, don't cross your arms.

1460
01:33:11,624 --> 01:33:14,082
- I won't be able to get a word otherwise.
- I know, I know, I know.

1461
01:33:14,249 --> 01:33:15,832
- I've got to get the truth from Quinlan.
- Yeah.

1462
01:33:16,082 --> 01:33:17,541
- On tape!
- He could stay there

1463
01:33:17,707 --> 01:33:19,707
the rest of the week like he used to.

1464
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:23,582
Now, look. Why don't you just take your
wife home and let me handle this thing?

1465
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:26,374
- It's my job.
- It's my job too, Menzies.

1466
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:27,749
It's my job.

1467
01:33:27,916 --> 01:33:29,249
It's my job too, Menzies.

1468
01:33:29,499 --> 01:33:31,999
You think I like it?
I hate this machine.

1469
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:35,291
- Spying, creeping--
- How do you think I feel about it?

1470
01:33:35,457 --> 01:33:37,166
Hank is the best friend I've ever had.

1471
01:33:37,791 --> 01:33:39,541
That's one reason for my staying.

1472
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:41,499
Oh, you don't trust me, huh?

1473
01:33:42,082 --> 01:33:44,124
Don't forget I was the one
that showed you that cane.

1474
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:45,707
I didn't have to do it, you know.

1475
01:33:46,832 --> 01:33:50,374
- Oh, yes, you did, Sergeant.
- Somebody could have planted it there.

1476
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:53,166
- Menzies.
- Besides Grandi's corpse.

1477
01:33:53,332 --> 01:33:54,874
You know better than that.

1478
01:33:55,249 --> 01:33:56,416
You say the reefers were planted.

1479
01:33:56,582 --> 01:33:58,124
- You know better.
- Why not Hank's cane?

1480
01:33:58,332 --> 01:34:01,582
- You're an honest cop.
- Sure, I am.

1481
01:34:02,916 --> 01:34:05,582
And who made me an honest cop?
Hank Quinlan.

1482
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:07,291
Come on, Menzies.

1483
01:34:07,582 --> 01:34:10,041
I am what I am because of him.

1484
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:20,624
What's my fortune?

1485
01:34:27,957 --> 01:34:31,999
- You been readin' the cards, haven't you?
- I've been doing the accounts.

1486
01:34:34,291 --> 01:34:36,624
Come on. Read my future for me.

1487
01:34:40,457 --> 01:34:41,499
You haven't got any.

1488
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:44,582
Hmm? What do you mean?

1489
01:34:46,916 --> 01:34:48,791
Your future is all used up.

1490
01:34:55,374 --> 01:34:57,124
Why don't you go home?

1491
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:16,749
Vargas. Vargas.

1492
01:35:17,082 --> 01:35:19,457
I don't know if you can
hear me over that piano music,

1493
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:21,666
but I'll get him out of there
so you can hear.

1494
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:56,124
I'll get him out, away from that music.

1495
01:35:56,291 --> 01:35:57,749
Be sure he doesn't see you.

1496
01:36:01,624 --> 01:36:03,541
I must be drunk.

1497
01:36:05,707 --> 01:36:07,582
A minute ago,

1498
01:36:09,416 --> 01:36:10,791
I thought you were Vargas.

1499
01:36:11,416 --> 01:36:12,791
Come on out, Hank.

1500
01:36:13,416 --> 01:36:15,791
- What's that?
- Come on out, Hank. I'm tired.

1501
01:36:15,957 --> 01:36:16,999
Who told you to come here?

1502
01:36:17,166 --> 01:36:18,916
I'm tired of waiting, Hank.

1503
01:36:19,082 --> 01:36:20,541
There's some questions you gotta answer.

1504
01:36:20,707 --> 01:36:21,832
Questions?

1505
01:36:24,249 --> 01:36:25,249
Questions?

1506
01:36:26,291 --> 01:36:27,957
I need another drink.

1507
01:36:28,832 --> 01:36:30,124
You had enough.

1508
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:33,957
That's what Tana keeps telling me.
How much is enough?

1509
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:40,666
<i>Hank, I'm sick of chasing
around, trying to get at the truth.</i>

1510
01:36:40,832 --> 01:36:43,249
<i>You could use a drink
yourself, partner.</i>

1511
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:46,166
<i>You gotta answer, Hank,
all kinds of things.</i>

1512
01:36:46,332 --> 01:36:48,541
<i>- First about Vargas's gun.</i>
- <i>How do you know about the gun?</i>

1513
01:36:52,124 --> 01:36:54,041
- <i>He thinks you took it.</i>
- <i>Vargas?</i>

1514
01:36:54,749 --> 01:36:56,374
<i>Or was it Grandi that stole it?</i>

1515
01:36:57,791 --> 01:36:59,707
<i>You've been
talkin' to Vargas, huh?</i>

1516
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:01,416
<i>Then you took it from Grandi?</i>

1517
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:04,249
<i>You been gettin' kind of chummy,
you and that Mexican.</i>

1518
01:37:05,082 --> 01:37:07,416
Does that explain that thing
you're carrying around now?

1519
01:37:09,207 --> 01:37:10,416
What's it called?

1520
01:37:11,707 --> 01:37:13,166
<i>That thing you're wearin'?</i>

1521
01:37:14,791 --> 01:37:17,416
- What I'm wearing?
- Sure.

1522
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:21,166
- That halo.
- Halo?

1523
01:37:21,332 --> 01:37:23,291
Looks real pretty on you, Pete.

1524
01:37:26,499 --> 01:37:28,999
Pretty soon you'll be flappin'
your wings like an angel.

1525
01:37:35,749 --> 01:37:36,791
<i>Look out.</i>

1526
01:37:38,749 --> 01:37:42,207
Vargas will turn you into one of these
here starry-eyed idealists.

1527
01:37:42,374 --> 01:37:44,457
<i>They're the ones makin'
all the real trouble in the world.</i>

1528
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:46,832
Be careful. They're worse than crooks.

1529
01:37:46,999 --> 01:37:49,124
You can always do somethin' with a crook.

1530
01:37:49,291 --> 01:37:50,832
You're the one that should be
careful, Hank--

1531
01:37:50,999 --> 01:37:52,374
- Huh? What?
- ...dealin' with crooks.

1532
01:37:52,541 --> 01:37:54,457
<i>Sometimes you can turn
into a crook yourself.</i>

1533
01:37:54,624 --> 01:37:55,874
<i>Look what happened with Grandi.</i>

1534
01:37:56,041 --> 01:37:59,041
<i>Partner, nobody ever
called me a crook.</i>

1535
01:38:04,041 --> 01:38:06,374
Look! Look up there!

1536
01:38:07,541 --> 01:38:08,666
See?

1537
01:38:10,374 --> 01:38:11,416
That oil pump.

1538
01:38:12,582 --> 01:38:14,374
Pumpin' up money.

1539
01:38:16,791 --> 01:38:18,207
Money.

1540
01:38:18,457 --> 01:38:21,999
Don't you think I could have been rich,
a cop in my position?

1541
01:38:22,916 --> 01:38:25,124
- What do I have?
- Tell me about Grandi, Hank.

1542
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:28,457
After 30 years.
A little turkey ranch, that's all I got.

1543
01:38:28,916 --> 01:38:31,666
- A couple of acres.
- We gotta talk about Grandi.

1544
01:38:35,416 --> 01:38:36,791
<i>An honest cop.</i>

1545
01:38:37,166 --> 01:38:38,707
<i>Then this Mexican comes along</i>

1546
01:38:38,874 --> 01:38:40,166
and look at the spot he puts me in!

1547
01:38:40,332 --> 01:38:42,374
- You can't blame Vargas for what ha--
- Blame Vargas?

1548
01:38:46,207 --> 01:38:47,999
- I blame Vargas for everything.
- Hank, don't be crazy.

1549
01:38:48,166 --> 01:38:49,166
Crazy.

1550
01:38:50,832 --> 01:38:52,749
<i>If it wasn't for him,
you think I'd be in a situation</i>

1551
01:38:52,916 --> 01:38:54,249
<i>where Grandi could blackmail me?</i>

1552
01:38:54,416 --> 01:38:56,791
<i>- Of course, when I had to defend myself--</i>
- <i>"Defend yourself"?</i>

1553
01:38:56,957 --> 01:38:58,874
- <i>Hank, you must be crazy.</i>
- <i>Sure.</i>

1554
01:38:59,041 --> 01:39:00,332
- <i>Insane!</i>
- <i>Sure, I'm crazy.</i>

1555
01:39:00,499 --> 01:39:04,124
<i>"Defend yourself”?
Hank, you murdered Grandi.</i>

1556
01:39:04,457 --> 01:39:07,124
<i>I left my cane by his body.
That was sure crazy.</i>

1557
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:10,624
All right. Let's start in the beginning.

1558
01:39:10,916 --> 01:39:14,291
- What about Vargas's gun?
- I was talking about my cane.

1559
01:39:14,457 --> 01:39:16,374
- The gun!
- I forgot it.

1560
01:39:16,541 --> 01:39:18,916
- The gun you stole from his briefcase.
- Gun?

1561
01:39:19,166 --> 01:39:21,999
- Vargas's gun! Vargas's!
- Vargas! Vargas! Vargas!

1562
01:39:22,166 --> 01:39:23,999
All you want to talk about is Vargas!

1563
01:39:27,916 --> 01:39:30,541
You took the gun from his briefcase,
but you didn't use it.

1564
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:33,416
<i>- Grandi was strangled.</i>
- <i>Grandi was a crook.</i>

1565
01:39:33,791 --> 01:39:35,874
- <i>You're a killer, Hank.</i>
- <i>Partner,</i>

1566
01:39:36,582 --> 01:39:39,124
-I'm a cop.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1567
01:39:39,291 --> 01:39:42,749
Drunk and crazy, as you must have been
when you strangled him.

1568
01:39:43,457 --> 01:39:45,957
I guess you were somehow
thinking of your wife,

1569
01:39:46,249 --> 01:39:47,957
the way she was strangled.

1570
01:39:48,124 --> 01:39:50,624
Well, I'm always thinking of her,

1571
01:39:51,124 --> 01:39:53,041
drunk or sober.

1572
01:39:54,332 --> 01:39:57,874
What else is there to think about?
Except my job.

1573
01:39:58,541 --> 01:40:00,207
My dirty job!

1574
01:40:00,791 --> 01:40:02,332
You didn't have to make it dirty.

1575
01:40:02,499 --> 01:40:04,666
I don't call it dirty. Look at the record.

1576
01:40:06,249 --> 01:40:08,582
<i>- Our record, partner.</i>
- <i>Sure. Sure. Sure.</i>

1577
01:40:08,749 --> 01:40:12,124
Well, all those...convictions.

1578
01:40:12,749 --> 01:40:14,582
Convictions, sure.

1579
01:40:14,749 --> 01:40:16,832
- How many did you frame?
- <i>Nobody.</i>

1580
01:40:16,999 --> 01:40:18,874
Come on, Hank.
How many did you frame?

1581
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:20,999
I told you. Nobody.

1582
01:40:22,499 --> 01:40:25,707
Nobody that wasn't guilty. Guilty.

1583
01:40:27,041 --> 01:40:28,332
<i>Guilty.</i>

1584
01:40:30,749 --> 01:40:33,041
Every last one of 'em. Guilty.

1585
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:37,166
All these years you been playin' me
for a sucker,

1586
01:40:37,499 --> 01:40:40,541
<i>- faking evidence.</i>
- <i>Aiding justice, partner.</i>

1587
01:40:40,707 --> 01:40:44,249
- Yeah, like the ax in the Berger case.
- Oh, yeah. Remember that?

1588
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:48,291
I was the one that found the ax,
just where you planted it for me to find.

1589
01:40:48,457 --> 01:40:50,582
- Just like the dynamite with Sanchez.

1590
01:40:50,749 --> 01:40:52,332
Just like you planted that dynamite!

1591
01:40:52,499 --> 01:40:53,832
Don't you think Sanchez is guilty?

1592
01:40:53,999 --> 01:40:55,916
- He's guilty. He'll confess.

1593
01:40:57,374 --> 01:40:59,916
Hey! Listen to that.

1594
01:41:02,666 --> 01:41:04,832
- Hank, I'm gonna have to--
- Shut up.

1595
01:41:05,207 --> 01:41:06,499
- Hear that?

1596
01:41:08,707 --> 01:41:10,582
- Hear what?
- Like an echo.

1597
01:41:21,666 --> 01:41:22,916
- Vargas?

1598
01:41:26,166 --> 01:41:28,791
<i>I've got a feeling
he's some place around here...</i>

1599
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:32,457
close to me.

1600
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:35,582
I got a hunch.

1601
01:41:35,749 --> 01:41:36,957
Why Vargas? Wh--wh--why should he--

1602
01:41:37,124 --> 01:41:39,249
You sound kind of nervous, Pete.

1603
01:41:42,499 --> 01:41:44,332
Well, my game leg...

1604
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:49,124
is startin' to talk to me.

1605
01:41:52,207 --> 01:41:53,207
Vargas.

1606
01:42:01,166 --> 01:42:04,291
Maybe he's tailin' me with a bug.

1607
01:42:07,332 --> 01:42:08,332
Recordin'--

1608
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:12,874
Hey! Are you carrying a bug for him?

1609
01:42:13,041 --> 01:42:15,374
- A microphone? Don't lie to me!
- Hank, I--

1610
01:42:15,791 --> 01:42:16,957
All right, all right.

1611
01:42:17,207 --> 01:42:18,291
<i>Now, you better give me that gun.</i>

1612
01:42:18,457 --> 01:42:19,916
<i>Where is he?</i>

1613
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:21,291
<i>Where is he?</i>

1614
01:42:21,666 --> 01:42:23,499
How did you figure
to frame Vargas with it?

1615
01:42:23,666 --> 01:42:25,416
Framed? Who's been framed?

1616
01:42:25,582 --> 01:42:26,791
<i>Where is he?</i>

1617
01:42:27,874 --> 01:42:28,874
<i>Vargas!</i>

1618
01:42:29,707 --> 01:42:31,124
- Where is he?
- Hank, look, I--

1619
01:42:31,291 --> 01:42:34,874
I'm talkin' to Vargas now.
Vargas! You hear me?

1620
01:42:36,041 --> 01:42:37,041
I'm talkin' to you

1621
01:42:37,207 --> 01:42:39,916
through this--this walkin' microphone
that used to work for me.

1622
01:42:40,082 --> 01:42:42,082
- I ain't workin' for Vargas.
- Vargas! Vargas!

1623
01:42:42,332 --> 01:42:43,666
<i>I'm workin'
for the department, Hank.</i>

1624
01:42:43,832 --> 01:42:45,999
<i>- Better give me Vargas's gun.</i>
- <i>Okay. Here it is.</i>

1625
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:47,457
- Give it to me.
- Vargas!

1626
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,832
Hank. Ha--

1627
01:43:44,207 --> 01:43:45,457
Well, Captain,

1628
01:43:46,874 --> 01:43:50,332
I'm afraid this is finally something
you can't talk your way out of.

1629
01:43:52,541 --> 01:43:53,749
Are you willing to bet?

1630
01:43:57,791 --> 01:43:59,166
You killed him, Vargas.

1631
01:43:59,749 --> 01:44:02,249
Come on, now. Give me my gun back.

1632
01:44:04,624 --> 01:44:07,166
You don't understand me. You killed Pete.

1633
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:10,832
The bullet is from your gun.

1634
01:44:12,874 --> 01:44:14,624
You think anyone would believe that?

1635
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:16,374
They always believe me.

1636
01:44:17,791 --> 01:44:20,874
Anyway, they'd never believe I killed him.

1637
01:44:21,916 --> 01:44:24,832
- The gun.
- You're resisting arrest.

1638
01:44:26,749 --> 01:44:29,666
How could you arrest me here?
This is my country.

1639
01:44:30,624 --> 01:44:32,707
And this is where you're gonna die.

1640
01:44:40,041 --> 01:44:42,457
That was no miss, Vargas.
That was just to turn you around!

1641
01:44:42,624 --> 01:44:44,124
I don't want to shoot you in the back.

1642
01:44:46,082 --> 01:44:49,207
Unless you'd rather...try to run for it.

1643
01:45:13,416 --> 01:45:15,666
Schwartz! Is she there?

1644
01:45:15,832 --> 01:45:17,791
- Did you bring my wife?
- She's in the car.

1645
01:45:18,249 --> 01:45:21,041
That's Menzies. He's dead.
Quinlan's been shot too.

1646
01:45:21,207 --> 01:45:24,249
He's lying by the recorder.
Down there. I've got it all on tape.

1647
01:45:24,416 --> 01:45:25,416
You sure you got enough?

1648
01:45:25,582 --> 01:45:27,416
More than enough.
Go play it back. You'll see.

1649
01:45:34,749 --> 01:45:36,041
- Susie.
- Oh, Mike.

1650
01:45:41,457 --> 01:45:44,249
<i>All these years you been
playin' me for a sucker,</i>

1651
01:45:45,374 --> 01:45:46,749
<i>faking evidence.</i>

1652
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:49,166
<i>Aiding justice, partner.</i>

1653
01:45:50,957 --> 01:45:52,249
Hank.

1654
01:45:53,707 --> 01:45:55,916
- Susie.
- Oh, Mike.

1655
01:45:56,957 --> 01:45:59,207
It's all over, Susie. I'm taking you home.

1656
01:46:00,166 --> 01:46:01,374
Home.

1657
01:46:04,832 --> 01:46:06,041
<i>How many did you frame?</i>

1658
01:46:06,249 --> 01:46:08,832
<i>Nobody that wasn't guilty.
Guilty.</i>

1659
01:46:09,374 --> 01:46:10,499
Hank!

1660
01:46:10,666 --> 01:46:11,832
<i>No, I ain't workin' for Vargas.</i>

1661
01:46:11,999 --> 01:46:13,291
<i>Vargas! Vargas!</i>

1662
01:46:13,457 --> 01:46:15,332
- <i>...better give me that gun.</i>
- <i>Okay, here it is.</i>

1663
01:46:15,499 --> 01:46:16,791
- <i>Give it to me!</i>
- <i>Vargas!</i>

1664
01:46:20,957 --> 01:46:23,832
Pete, that's the second bullet that...

1665
01:46:24,666 --> 01:46:25,874
I stopped for you.

1666
01:46:47,707 --> 01:46:49,999
His famous intuition was right after all.

1667
01:46:50,166 --> 01:46:53,291
He framed that Mexican kid, Sanchez,
but he didn't even need to.

1668
01:46:53,457 --> 01:46:55,124
The kid confessed about that bomb.

1669
01:46:56,374 --> 01:47:00,249
So, it turns out Quinlan
was right after all.

1670
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:04,499
Isn't somebody going to come
and take him away?

1671
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,041
Yeah, in just a few minutes.

1672
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:08,541
You really liked him, didn't you?

1673
01:47:10,249 --> 01:47:11,374
The cop did.

1674
01:47:12,124 --> 01:47:14,541
The one who killed him. He loved him.

1675
01:47:15,374 --> 01:47:17,541
Well, Hank was a great detective,
all right.

1676
01:47:18,332 --> 01:47:19,791
And a lousy cop.

1677
01:47:20,707 --> 01:47:22,416
Is that all you have to say for him?

1678
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:25,874
He was some kind of a man.

1679
01:47:29,582 --> 01:47:31,874
What does it matter
what you say about people?

1680
01:47:39,291 --> 01:47:40,832
Good-bye, Tana.

1681
01:47:42,249 --> 01:47:44,124
<i>Adiós.</i>
